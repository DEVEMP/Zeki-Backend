Although its efﬁcacy has been established, data are conﬂicting\nwhether it is safer than neostigmine traditionally used for reversing NMB.\nDesign: Meta-analysis of data about effectiveness and safety of sugammadex compared to neostigmine for\nreversing NMB in adults was performed using the PRISMA methodology.\nSetting: University medical hospital.\nMethods: A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane\nLibrary electronic databases to identify English-language randomized controlled trials. Two reviewers\nindependently selected the trials; extracted data on reversal times, incomplete reversals of NMB, and adverse\nevents (AEs); and assessed the trials\' methodological quality and evidence level. Only AEs that were related\nto study drug by a blinded safety assessor were considered for meta-analysis.\nPatients: A total of 1384 patients from 13 articles were included in this meta-analysis.\nMain results: Compared to neostigmine, sugammadex was faster in reversing NMB (P b .0001) and more\nlikely to be associated with higher train-of-four ratio values at extubation (mean difference, 0.18; 95%\nconﬁdence interval [CI], 0.14-0.22; P b .0001) and lower risk of postoperative residual curarization after\nextubation (odds ratio [OR], 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.43; P = .0068).

Previous\nstudies suggest that sugammadex is effective in reversing\nmoderate neuromuscular block in the presence of renal\nfailure, but no data are available regarding reversal of pro-\nfound neuromuscular block in patients with renal failure.\nOBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to compare the\nefﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex in reversing profound\nneuromuscular block induced by rocuronium in patients with\nend-stage renal disease and those with normal renal function.\nDESIGN A prospective clinical trial.\nSETTING Two university hospitals, from 1 October 2011 to\n31 January 2012.\nPATIENTS Forty patients undergoing kidney transplant: 20\n<30mlmin 1\nwith renal failure [creatinine clearance (ClCr) ]\n>90mlmin 1\nand 20 control patients (ClCr ).\nthree responses) was maintained during surgery. Sugamma-\ndex4mgkg 1 wasadministeredoncompletionofskinclosure.\nRecovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was recorded. Monitoring of\nneuromuscular function continued in the postanesthesia care\nunit for a further 2h.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The efﬁcacy of sugammadex\nwas evaluated by the time taken for the TOF ratio to recover\nto 0.9. The safety of sugammadex was assessed by monitor-\ning for recurrence of neuromuscular block every 15min for\n2h. Secondary variables were time to recovery of TOF ratio\nto 0.7 and 0.8.\nRESULTS After sugammadex administration, the mean time\nfor recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9was prolonged in the renal\nfailure group (5.6   3.6min) compared with the control group\n(2.7   1.3min, P ¼ 0.003). No adverse events or evidence of\nrecurrence of neuromuscular block were observed.\nCONCLUSION In patients with renal failure, sugammadex\n(4mgkg 1) effectively and safely reversed profound rocur-\nonium induced neuromuscular block, but the recovery was\nslower than healthy patients.\n \nTRIAL REGISTRATION Clinicaltrials.gov identiﬁer NCT0\nINTERVENTION Neuromuscular monitoring was performed\n1785758.\nby acceleromyography and train-of-four (TOF) stimulation.\nProfound neuromuscular block (posttetanic count, one to Published online 29 July 2015\n', '2019-07-03 23:25:58', 1),

Background\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine, have traditionally been used for reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular\nblocking agents. However, these drugs have signiﬁcant limitations, such as indirect mechanisms of reversal, limited and unpredictable\nefﬁcacy, and undesirable autonomic responses. Sugammadex is a selective relaxant-binding agent speciﬁcally developed for rapid reversal\nof non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium. Its potential clinical beneﬁts include fast and predictable reversal\nof any degree of block, increased patient safety, reduced incidence of residual block on recovery, and more efﬁcient use of healthcare\nresources.\nObjectives\nThe main objective of this review was to compare the efﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular\nblockade caused by non-depolarizing neuromuscular agents in adults.\nSearch methods\nWe searched the following databases on 2 May 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE\n(WebSPIRS Ovid SP), Embase (WebSPIRS Ovid SP), and the clinical trials registries www.controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and\nwww.centerwatch.com. We re-ran the search on 10 May 2017.\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes\npublished, or language. We included adults, classiﬁed as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I to IV, who received non-\ndepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents for an elective in-patient or day-case surgical procedure. We included all trials comparing\nsugammadex versus neostigmine that reported recovery times or adverse events. We included any dose of sugammadex and neostigmine\nand any time point of study drug administration.\nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review) 1\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to identify trials for eligibility, examined articles for eligibility, abstracted\ndata, assessed the articles, and excluded obviously irrelevant reports. We resolved disagreements by discussion between review authors\nand further disagreements through consultation with the last review author. We assessed risk of bias in 10 methodological domains\nusing the Cochrane risk of bias tool and examined risk of random error through trial sequential analysis. We used the principles of the\nGRADE approach to prepare an overall assessment of the quality of evidence. For our primary outcomes (recovery times to train-of-\nfour ratio (TOFR) > 0.9), we presented data as mean differences (MDs) with 95 % conﬁdence intervals (CIs), and for our secondary\noutcomes (risk of adverse events and risk of serious adverse events), we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with CIs.\nMain results\nWe included 41 studies (4206 participants) in this updated review, 38 of which were new studies. Twelve trials were eligible for meta-\nanalysis of primary outcomes (n = 949), 28 trials were eligible for meta-analysis of secondary outcomes (n = 2298), and 10 trials (n =\n1647) were ineligible for meta-analysis.\nWe compared sugammadex 2 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg for reversal of rocuronium-induced moderate neuromuscular blockade\n(NMB). Sugammadex 2 mg/kg was 10.22 minutes (6.6 times) faster then neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (1.96 vs 12.87 minutes) in reversing\nNMB from the second twitch (T2) to TOFR > 0.9 (MD 10.22 minutes, 95% CI 8.48 to 11.96; I2 = 84%; 10 studies, n = 835;\nGRADE: moderate quality).\nWe compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg for reversal of rocuronium-induced deep NMB. Sugammadex 4\nmg/kg was 45.78 minutes (16.8 times) faster then neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (2.9 vs 48.8 minutes) in reversing NMB from post-tetanic\ncount (PTC) 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9 (MD 45.78 minutes, 95% CI 39.41 to 52.15; I2 = 0%; two studies, n = 114; GRADE: low quality).\nFor our secondary outcomes, we compared sugammadex, any dose, and neostigmine, any dose, looking at risk of adverse and serious\nadverse events. We found signiﬁcantly fewer composite adverse events in the sugammadex group compared with the neostigmine group\n(RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.74; I2 = 40%; 28 studies, n = 2298; GRADE: moderate quality). Risk of adverse events was 28% in the\nneostigmine group and 16% in the sugammadex group, resulting in a number needed to treat for an additional beneﬁcial outcome\n(NNTB) of 8. When looking at speciﬁc adverse events, we noted signiﬁcantly less risk of bradycardia (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34; I\n2\n\n= 0%; 11 studies, n = 1218; NNTB 14; GRADE: moderate quality), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (RR 0.52, 95% CI\n0.28 to 0.97; I2 = 0%; six studies, n = 389; NNTB 16; GRADE: low quality) and overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis (RR\n0.40, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.57; I2 = 0%; 15 studies, n = 1474; NNTB 13; GRADE: moderate quality) in the sugammadex group when\ncompared with the neostigmine group. Finally, we found no signiﬁcant differences between sugammadex and neostigmine regarding\nrisk of serious adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.25; I2= 0%; 10 studies, n = 959; GRADE: low quality).\nApplication of trial sequential analysis (TSA) indicates superiority of sugammadex for outcomes such as recovery time from T2 to\nTOFR > 0.9, adverse events, and overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis.\nAuthors’ conclusions\nReview results suggest that in comparison with neostigmine, sugammadex can more rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced neuromus-\ncular block regardless of the depth of the block. Sugammadex 2 mg/kg is 10.22 minutes (~ 6.6 times) faster in reversing moderate\nneuromuscular blockade (T2) than neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (GRADE: moderate quality), and sugammadex 4 mg/kg is 45.78 minutes\n(~ 16.8 times) faster in reversing deep neuromuscular blockade (PTC 1 to 5) than neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (GRADE: low quality).\nWith an NNTB of 8 to avoid an adverse event, sugammadex appears to have a better safety proﬁle than neostigmine. Patients receiving\nsugammadex had 40% fewer adverse events compared with those given neostigmine. Speciﬁcally, risks of bradycardia (RR 0.16, NNTB\n14; GRADE: moderate quality), PONV (RR 0.52, NNTB 16; GRADE: low quality), and overall signs of postoperative residual\nparalysis (RR 0.40, NNTB 13; GRADE: moderate quality) were reduced. Both sugammadex and neostigmine were associated with\nserious adverse events in less than 1% of patients, and data showed no differences in risk of serious adverse events between groups (RR\n0.54; GRADE: low quality).\n', '2019-07-03 23:25:58', 1),

The current study aimed to assess re-\ncovery from deep rocuronium-induced NMB \nwith sugammadex compared with place-\nbo, provide data regarding the extent of re-\nsidual blockade after deep rocuronium-in-\nduced NMB (placebo group), and to deter-\nmine whether complete and reliable recovery \ncould be provided by sugammadex (sugam-\nmadex group).\nMaterials and methods.

Recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 with \nsugammadex was significantly faster (~ 40 \ntimes) than spontaneous recovery: geometric \nmean (95 % confidence interval) times were \n2.2 (1.9–2.5) and 89.8 (80.1–100.7) min, re-\n\nspectively (p < 0.0001, N = 134); maximum \nspontaneous recovery was 289.8 min.

Results were processed as average, \nminimum, and maximum values.\nResults: The period needed to reach train-of-four of 0.9 following sugammadex administration \nwas on average 117 seconds (minimum of 105 seconds/maximum of 127 seconds) and differed \nwithin deviation ,10%. The time to extubation following sugammadex administration was on \naverage 276 seconds (minimum of 251 seconds/maximum of 305 seconds) and differed mini-\nmally among patients as well. We observed no SpO2 ,95%, no pCO2 elevation .10% above \na baseline, no emergent reintubation within the first 48 hours, and no pneumonia diagnosed on \nclinical basis within 120 hours, postoperatively in all 117 patients.\nConclusion: In this cohort of MG patients undergoing surgery using rocuronium and \nsugammadex, we did not observe any signs of postoperative residual curarization and respiratory \ndepression.

Objective: The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of introducing \na rocuronium–neostigmine–sugammadex strategy into a cisatracurium–neostigmine regimen \nfor neuromuscular block (NMB) management.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness \nin five operating rooms at University Hospital of Padova. A clinical outcome evaluation after \nsugammadex administration as first-choice reversal drug in selected patients (rocuronium–\nsugammadex) and as rescue therapy after neostigmine reversal (rocuronium–neostigmine–\nsugammadex) compared to control was performed. A cost-analysis of NMB management \naccompanying the introduction of a rocuronium–neostigmine–sugammadex strategy into a \ncisatracurium–neostigmine regimen was carried out. To such purpose, two periods were com-\npared: 2011–2012, without sugammadex available; 2013–2014, with sugammadex available. \nA subsequent analysis was performed to evaluate if sugammadex replacing neostigmine as first \nchoice reversal drug is cost-effective.\nResults: The introduction of a rocuronium–neostigmine–sugammadex strategy into a \nc isatracurium–neostigmine regimen reduced the average cost of NMB management by 36%, from \n€20.8/case to €13.3/case. Patients receiving sugammadex as a first-choice reversal drug (3%) \nexhibited significantly better train-of-four ratios at extubation (P,0.001) and were discharged \nto the surgical ward (P,0.001) more rapidly than controls. The cost-saving of sugammadex as \nfirst-choice reversal drug has been estimated to be €2.9/case. Patients receiving sugammadex \nas rescue therapy after neostigmine reversal (3.2%) showed no difference in time to discharge \nto the surgical ward (P=0.44) compared to controls. No unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) \nadmissions with rocuronium–neostigmine–sugammadex strategy were observed. The potential \neconomic benefit in avoiding postoperative residual curarization (PORC)-related ICU admission \nin the 2013–2014 period was estimated at an average value of €13,548 (€9,316–€23,845).\nConclusion: Sugammadex eliminated PORC and associated morbidities.

Background: Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil is widely used in neuroanaesthesiology \nand enables the quick recovery and early neurological assessment of patients. The administration of muscle relaxants \ncarries a risk of residual relaxation following surgery. The administration of a suitable dose of sugammadex reverses \nthe neuromuscular block irrespective of its depth and has none of the side effects associated with acetylcholinesterase \ninhibitors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of sugammadex for the reversal of vecuronium-\ninduced effects following intracranial surgery. \nMethod: The study involved 38 women who underwent supratentorial tumour removal. These women were randomly \ndivided into two groups. Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusion \nwas administered according to the Schnider and Minto models, respectively. Endotracheal intubation was performed \nafter the target concentrations of propofol and remifentanil reached 4 µg mL-1 and 4 ng mL-1, respectively. Vecuro-\nnium (100 µg kg-1) was administered, and no response to TOF stimulation was observed. Relaxation was continued \nvia the continuous infusion of vecuronium (0.8–1.2 µg kg-1 min-1) to provide a TOF of 2 throughout the surgery. In \ngroup I, neuromuscular conduction was restored with intravenous sugammadex (2 mg kg-1), whereas in group II, no \nreversal agents were administered.\nResults: The times of the return of spontaneous breathing, extubation, eye opening (both spontaneous and in re-\nsponse to a verbal command) were found to be longer in group II than group I. \nConclusion: The use of sugammadex following craniotomy accelerates the achievement of optimal extubation \nconditions.

Background. During laparotomy, surgeons may experience difﬁcult surgical conditions if the patient’s abdominal wall or\ndiaphragm is tense. Deep neuromuscular block (NMB), deﬁned as a post-tetanic-count (PTC) between 0-1, paralyses the\nabdominal wall muscles and the diaphragm. We hypothesized that deep NMB (PTC 0-1) would improve subjective ratings of\nsurgical conditions during upper laparotomy as compared with standard NMB.\nMethods. This was a double blinded, randomized study. A total of 128 patients undergoing elective upper laparotomy were\nrandomized to either continuous deep NMB (infusion of rocuronium 2 mg ml 1) or standard NMB (bolus of rocuronium\n10 mg or increased depth of anaesthesia). Surgical conditions were evaluated using a 5-point subjective rating scale\n(1: extremely poor, 5: optimal) every 30 min. Primary outcome was the average of scores for a patient’s surgical conditions.\nOther outcomes were surgical rating score during fascial closure, episodes of a need to optimize surgical conditions, occur-\nrence of wound dehiscence, and wound infection.\nResults. Deep compared with standard NMB resulted in better ratings of surgical conditions; median 4.75 (range 3–5) com-\npared with 4.00 (range 1–5) (P<0.001), respectively. Deep compared with standard NMB resulted in better ratings of surgical\nconditions during fascial closure (P<0.001), fewer episodes of need to optimize surgical conditions (P<0.001), and fewer inci-\ndents with sudden movements (P<0.001). No differences in operating time, occurrence of wound infection, and wound\ndehiscence were found.\nConclusions.

Background The beneﬁcial effects of deep blockade are not fully known. In this study, we evaluated the effect of\ndeep neuromuscular blockade on surgical conditions during laparoscopic cholecystectomy under low-pressure\npneumoperitoneum.\nMethods Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to either the moderate group\n(train-of-four count of 1 or 2) or deep group (posttetanic count of 1 or 2). Neuromuscular blockade was induced and\nmaintained with rocuronium; it was reversed with sugammadex in the deep group and with neostigmine in the\nmoderate group. At the beginning of surgery, the intra-abdominal pressure was set at 8 mmHg. The surgeon rated the\nsurgical condition on a 4-point scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = acceptable, 4 = poor) and was allowed to\nincrease the pressure to 12 mmHg if it was determined that the surgical conditions were inadequate for the operation.\nResults A total of 64 patients completed the study.

(72, '1562168408', 'Chatbot', 'Effects of Neostigmine and Sugammadex for Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade on QT Dispersion Under Propofol Anesthesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Introduction: Reversal of non-depolarizing neu-\nromuscular blocking agent neostigmine is\nassociated with QT prolongation under general\nanesthesia. To clarify the effects of neostigmine\nand sugammadex on hemodynamic status, the\nQT interval and QT dispersion after reversal of\nneuromuscular blockade were evaluated with a\n12-lead electrocardiogram. To exclude QT pro-\nlongation due to sevoﬂurane, the present study\nwas performed under propofol anesthesia.\nMethods: After receiving approval from the\nethics committee of Dokkyo Medical University\nHospital, 40 patients with American Society of\nAnesthesiologists physical status I or II were\nrandomly allocated to group N (n = 20) or group\nS (n = 20). Group N was administered neostig-\nmine (40 lg/kg) and atropine (20 lg/kg), while\nGroup S was administered sugammadex (4 mg/\nkg) for reversal of neuromuscular blockade after\nsurgery. The changes in RR interval, QT interval\n(QT), corrected QT interval (QTc), QT disper-\nsion (QTD), and corrected QT dispersion (QTcD)\n\nbefore and after administration of reversal\nagents were recorded using computerized mea-\nsurements. Statistical analysis was performed\nusing two-way analysis of variance.\nResults: The RR interval signiﬁcantly decreased\nafter reversal of the neuromuscular blockade in\ngroup N, compared with group S (p \\ 0.05).\nCompared with group S, the QT decreased,\nwhereas QTc and QTcD increased, in group N\n(p \\ 0.05). Sugammadex was not found to alter\nQT, QTc, QTD, or QTcD throughout the study.\nConclusion: In the present study, a mixture of\nneostigmine and atropine, but not sugam-\nmadex, increased QTc and QTcD under propo-\nfol anesthesia. Thus, neostigmine may cause\nelectrocardiogram abnormalities that could\nprecede the development of fatal arrhythmias.', '2019-07-03 23:25:59', 1),

Recent data shows that a neuromuscular block (NMB) induced by administration of high doses\nof rocuronium improves surgical conditions in certain procedures. However, there are limited\ndata on the effect such practices on postoperative outcomes. We performed a retrospective\nanalysis to compare unplanned 30-day readmissions in patients that received high-dose ver-\nsus low-dose rocuronium administration during general anesthesia for laparoscopic retroperito-\nneal surgery. This retrospective cohort study was performed in the Netherlands in an academic\nhospital where routine high-dose rocuronium NMB has been practiced since July 2015. Charts\nof patients receiving anesthesia between January 2014 and December 2016 were searched\nfor surgical cases receiving high-dose rocuronium and matched with respect to procedure,\nage, sex and ASA classification to patients receiving low-dose rocuronium. The primary post-\noperative outcome was unplanned 30-day readmission rate. There were 130 patients in each\ncohort. Patients in the high- and low-dose rocuronium cohorts received 217 ± 49 versus 37 ± 5\nmg rocuronium, respectively. In the high-dose rocuronium group neuromuscular activity was\nconsistently monitored; matched patients were unreliably monitored. All patients receiving\nhigh-dose rocuronium were reversed with sugammadex, while just 33% of matched patients\nwere reversed with sugammadex and 20% with neostigmine; the remaining patients were not\nreversed.

Objectives/Hypothesis: Laser microlaryngeal surgery (LMS) is a short operation requiring brief and intense paralysis.\nAdequate muscle relaxation and rapid recovery of neuromuscular function are essential for improving surgical conditions and\nreducing the incidence of complications during LMS. However, the ideal muscle relaxant with a rapid onset and short dura-\ntion of action is not yet available.

Background: Mild hypothermia may be frequently induced due to cool environments in the operating room. The\nstudy analyzed patient recovery time and response to sugammadex after a prolonged rocuronium-induced deep\nneuromuscular block (NMB) during mild hypothermia.\nMethods: Sixty patients were randomly (1:1) allocated to the mild hypothermia and normothermia groups, defined as\nhaving core temperatures between 34.5 - 35°C and 36.5 - 37°C, respectively. Patients received 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium,\nfollowed by 7 – 10 μg/kg/min to maintain a deep NMB [post-tetanic count (PTC) 1–2]. After surgery, the deep NMB was\nreversed with sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg. The primary end-point was the time until the train-of-four (TOF) ratio was 0.9.\nResults: The appropriate neuromuscular function (TOF ratio ≥ 0.9) was restored after sugammadex was administered,\neven after hypothermia. The length of recovery in the hypothermia patients [mean (SD), 171.1 (62.1) seconds (s)] was\nsignificantly slower compared with the normothermia patients [124.9 (59.2) s] (p = 0.005). There were no adverse effects\nfrom sugammadex.\nConclusions: Sugammadex safely and securely reversed deep rocuronium-induced NMB during mild hypothermia.

Background: Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular block (NMB) through binding aminosteroid neuromuscular\nblocking agents. Although sugammadex appears to be highly selective, it can interact with other drugs, like\ncorticosteroids. A prospective single-blinded randomized clinical trial was designed to explore the significance\nof interactions between dexamethasone and sugammadex.\nMethods: Sixty-five patients who were anesthetized for elective abdominal or urological surgery were included.\nNMB was assessed using train-of-four stimulation (TOF), with rocuronium used to maintain the desired NMB depth.\nNMB reversal at the end of anaesthesia was achieved using sugammadex. According to their received antiemetics,\nthe patients were randomized to either the granisetron or dexamethasone group.

IOP was measured in all patients at nine separate time points. All RALRPs were per-\nformed by one surgeon, who rated the overall and worst surgical conditions at the end of the\nST position.\nResults\nThe highest IOP value was observed at T4 (60 min after the ST position) in both Group M\n(23.3 ± 2.7 mmHg) and Group D (19.8 ± 2.1 mmHg). RALRP was accomplished at an IAP of\n8 mmHg in 88% Group D patients and 25% Group M patients.

However, there are no large well-controlled studies \nin women undergoing general anesthesia for cesarean delivery. The aim of this noninferiority trial \nwas to determine whether rocuronium and sugammadex confer benefit in time to tracheal intuba-\ntion (primary outcome) and other neuromuscular blockade outcomes compared with succinylcho-\nline, rocuronium, and neostigmine in women undergoing general anesthesia for cesarean delivery.\nMETHODS: We aimed to enroll all women undergoing general anesthesia for cesarean delivery \nin the 2 participating university hospitals (Brno, Olomouc, Czech Republic) in this single-blinded, \nrandomized, controlled study. Women were randomly assigned to the ROC group (muscle relax-\nation induced with rocuronium 1 mg/kg and reversed with sugammadex 2–4 mg/kg) or the \nSUX group (succinylcholine 1 mg/kg for induction, rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg for maintenance, and \nneostigmine 0.03 mg/kg for reversal of the neuromuscular blockade). The interval from the end \nof propofol administration to tracheal intubation was the primary end point with a noninferiority \nmargin of 20 seconds. We recorded intubating conditions (modified Viby-Mogensen score), neo-\nnatal outcome (Apgar score <7; umbilical artery pH), anesthesia complications, and subjective \npatient complaints 24 hours after surgery.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 240 parturients. The mean time to tracheal intubation was 2.9 seconds \nlonger in the ROC group (95% confidence interval, −5.3 to 11.2 seconds), noninferior compared \nwith the SUX group. Absence of laryngoscopy resistance was greater in the ROC than in the \nSUX groups (ROC, 87.5%; SUX, 74.2%; P = 0.019), but there were no differences in vocal cord \nposition (P = 0.45) or intubation response (P = 0.31) between groups. No statistically signifi-\ncant differences in incidence of anesthesia complications or in neonatal outcome were found \n(10-minute Apgar score <7, P = 0.07; umbilical artery pH, P = 0.43). The incidence of postpar-\ntum myalgia was greater in the SUX group (ROC 0%; SUX 6.7%; P = 0.007). The incidence of \nsubjective complaints was lower in the ROC group (ROC, 21.4%; SUX, 37.5%; P = 0.007).\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that rocuronium for rapid-sequence induction is noninferior for \ntime to tracheal intubation and is accompanied by more frequent absence of laryngoscopy resis-\ntance and lower incidence of myalgia in comparison with succinylcholine for cesarean delivery \nunder general anesthesia.

In this study, the combination of rocuronium for neuromuscular\nblockade (NMB) reversed by single-dose sugammadex was compared with succinylcholine followed by\nspontaneous recovery in outpatient surgery. This multicenter, randomized, safety assessor–blinded\nstudy enrolled adults undergoing a short elective outpatient surgical procedure requiring NMB and\ntracheal intubation. Patients were randomized to NMB with either rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg for tracheal\nintubation with incremental doses of rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg and subsequent reversal with sugamma-\ndex 4.0 mg/kg at 1–2 posttetanic counts or succinylcholine 1.0 mg/kg for intubation with spontaneous\nrecovery. The primary efficacy end point was the time from sugammadex administration to recovery of\nthe train-of-four ratio to 0.9; for succinylcholine, time from administration to recovery of the first twitch\n(T1) to 90% was assessed. From 167 patients enrolled, 150 received treatment. The all-subjects-treated\npopulation comprised 70 patients in the rocuronium–sugammadex group and 80 in the succinylcholine\ngroup. Geometric mean (95% confidence interval) time from the start of sugammadex administration to\nrecovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 was 1.8 (1.6–2.0) minutes. Geometric mean (95% confidence\ninterval) time from succinylcholine administration to recovery of T1 to 90% was 10.8 (10.1–11.5) minutes.\nHealth outcome variables were similar between the groups. Adverse events were reported in 87.1% and\n93.8% of patients for rocuronium–sugammadex and succinylcholine, respectively.

Objective: Some anaesthetists are convinced that a long interval since the last relaxant dose may be sufficient to recover from anaesthesia \nwithout a pharmacological reversal. We intended to demonstrate that the dosing pattern of rocuronium could not predict the necessity of \nreversal.\nMethods: In a cohort analysis, we retrospectively analysed 180 anaesthesia records of adult patients who underwent elective surgical interven-\ntions in general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation with rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. The extracted records were divided \nto 3 post hoc groups of 60 each, according to the reversal method employed at the end of anaesthesia: group N with neostigmine, group S \nwith sugammadex and group Z without pharmacological reversal. All cases were terminated after achieving a train of four ratio of 0.9. Dosing \npatterns of rocuronium were compared by applying a novel pharmacometric calculation method, residual drug activity coefficient (RDAC), \nwhich employs both the administered individual drug doses in mg kg-1 and the timing of each drug administration in relation to the time of \nextubation. The rocuronium dosing pattern was correlated with the employed method of neuromuscular blockade reversal.\nResults: The dosing for rocuronium in patients without pharmacological reversal was lower than that in both reversal agent groups \n(n=0.58±0.21, S=0.58±0.17 and Z=0.47±0.17), but there was still a large overlap in the RDAC.\nConclusion: The dosage profile of rocuronium alone cannot predict the possibility to refrain from pharmacological reversal.', '2019-07-03 23:26:00', 1),

Purpose There is little knowledge about how hospitals can best handle disruptions that reduce post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) capacity. Few hospitals in Japan have any PACU beds and instead have the anesthesiologists recover their patients in the operating room. We compared postoperative recovery times between a hospital with (University of Iowa) and without (Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital) a PACU.\nMethods This historical cohort study included 16 successive patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery with endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia, at each of the hospitals, and with the hours from OR entrance until the last surgical dressing applied C two hours. Postoperative recovery times, deﬁned as the end of surgery until leaving for the surgical ward, were compared between the hospitals.\nResults The median [interquartile range] of recovery times was 112 [94-140] min at the University of Iowa and 22 [18-29] min at the Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital. Every studied patient at the University of Iowa had a longer recovery time than every such patient at Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, P \\ 0.001). The ratio of the mean recovery times was 4.90 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 4.05 to 5.91; P \\ 0.001) and remained comparable after controlling for surgical duration (5.33; 95% CI, 3.66 to 7.76; P \\ 0.001). The anesthetics used in the Iowa hospital were a volatile agent, hydromorphone, ketorolac, and neostigmine compared with the Japanese hospital where bispectral index monitoring and target-controlled infusions of propofol, remifentanil, acetaminophen, and sugammadex were used. Conclusions This knowledge can be generally applied in situations at hospitals with regular PACU use when there are such large disruptions to PACU capacity that it is known before a case begins that the anesthesiologist likely will need to recover the patient (i.e., when there will not be an available PACU bed and/or nurse).

This study was conducted using\nPRISMA methodology.\nMeasurements: Time to discharge after NMB reversal with sugammadex or neostigmine.\nMain results: Compared with neostigmine, sugammadex was associated with a signiﬁcantly faster discharge from\nthe OR to the PACU (mean difference [MD] = 22.14 min, 95% CI (14.62, 29.67), P b 0.0001, I2 = 0%) and from the\nPACU to the surgical ward (MD = 16.95 min, 95% CI (0.23, 33.67), P = 0.0469, I2 = 98.4%). Similarly, discharge-\nreadiness was shorter for sugammadex than for neostigmine from the OR to the PACU (MD = 5.58 min, 95% CI\n(3.03, 8.14), P ≤0.0001, I2 = 0%). However, discharge-readiness was similar in both groups for patients moving\nfrom the PACU to the surgical ward (MD = −1.10 min, 95% CI (−5.69, 3.50), P = 0.6394, I2 = 25.3%).\nConclusions: Results from this meta-analysis suggest that sugammadex accelerates postoperative discharge of pa-\ntients after general anesthesia compared with neostigmine.', '2019-07-03 23:26:00', 1),

We aimed to compare \nrecovery times after sugammadex or neostigmine administration, and estimate the time spent \nin operating theater and the possible economic impact of a faster recovery, in morbidly obese \npatients undergoing bariatric surgery.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective study that analyzed data from records of morbidly \nobese patients (body mass index >40 kg/m2) undergoing elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery \nin which sugammadex or neostigmine were used to reverse NMB. Patients were divided in \ntwo groups: group 1 (sugammadex group [SUG]) received rocuronium and sugammadex for \nreversal and group 2 (neostigmine group [NEO]) received either rocuronium or cisatracurium \nand neostigmine.

Sugammadex cost \naccounted for 2.58% of the total cost per surgery, while neostigmine cost accounted for 0.06%. \nTotal time saved in SUG group was 19.4 hours, which could be used to perform 12 extra lapa-\nroscopic sleeve gastrectomies.\nConclusion: Reversal from NMB was significantly faster with sugammadex than with neostig-\nmine.

BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:101 	Page 2 of 10\n \n\n \nBackground\nSugammadex is the first selective muscle-relaxant-binding agent that acts by forming a complex with aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., rocuronium). This results in a rapid decrease in free rocuronium in the plasma [1], and causes a shift from the acetycholine recep-tors in the neuromuscular junction, down the concentra-tion gradient into the plasma. This allows rapid and effective reversal of neuromuscular block (NMB) of any depth. Sugammadex is excreted both rapidly and virtually unchanged via the urine [1, 2], as is the rocuronium– sugammadex complex, which resembles the pharmacoki-netic features of sugammadex [1, 3, 4].\nCorticosteroids have wide applications in anaesthesiology, as they are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in patients with chronic diseases [5]. Furthermore, corticoste-roids have an important role in states of hyper-reactive airway [6], anaphylaxis [7, 8], septic shock [9, 10], and laryngeal [11], cerebral [12, 13], and surgical edema [14], and they are also used in conjunction with multimodal analgesia [15–17] and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting [18–20]. Among the corticosteroids, dexamethasone is the most commonly used for the treat-ment of oedema and analgesia, and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Structurally, dexa-methasone closely resembles the aminosteroid neuromus-cular blocking agents, and therefore concerns have been raised about possible interference of such corticosteroids in the action of sugammadex [21–24].\nThere are two types of possible interactions of drugs with sugammadex that need to be taken into consider-ation: capturing and displacement. Capturing interac-tions can occur with oral contraceptives, where their free and active concentrations can be reduced by sugam-madex coadministration to such an extent that it has the effect of missing a daily dose of contraceptives [25, 26]. Displacement potential was tested in early in vitro stud-ies by Zhang [25], where isothermal titration calorimetry showed that over 40 lipophilic, steroid, and non-steroid drugs have some potential for interactions with sugammadex, although these affinities were 120-fold to 700-fold lower than that for the aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agent rocuronium. The same method was used in the study of Zwiers et al. [26], where 300 drugs were tested and modeled to deter-mine possibile drug interacts with sugammadex. Of all of these tested compounds, only three were considered possible for the displacement of rocuronium from sugam-madex: toremifene, fusidic acid and flucloxacillin [26, 27]. According to these model-based chemical studies and the theoretical molecular features, sugammadex appears highly selective for aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents, with the minimal possibility of interactions with other drugs.\nThis study was designed to investigate the in vivo significance of previously observed in vitro interactions between dexamethasone and sugammadex [21, 22] in surgical patients undergoing general anaesthesia, where sugammadex was used to reverse rocuronium-induced NMB. To explore this potential interaction we hypothe-sized that less sugammadex is available for rocuronium binding. In agreement, the plasma rocuronium concentra-tions increases to a lesser extent after sugammadex application in patients treated with dexamethasone, in comparison to patients without dexamethasone treatment.\nMethods\nThis prospective, single-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, single-centre study was retrospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ANZCTR) and was assigned trial number ACTRN12612000245897 and universal trial number U1111-1128-5104. The study protocol was approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia (permit number 161/02/11). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients enrolled. The study was performed at the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Therapy, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia, and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines and Good Clinical Practice.\nSubject recruitment\nThe patients included were aged 18 years or more, with American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I-III, and were anesthetized for elective abdominal or uro-logical surgery for which they needed tracheal intubation and deep NMB throughout the procedure. The exclusion criteria were: lack of consent, diagnosed neuromuscular disease, anticipated difficult intubation, severe kidney failure, personal or family history of malignant hyper-thermia, known allergic reaction to any of the anaes-thetics used, pregnancy or nursing, and taking oral contraceptives or drugs already known to interact with sugammadex. The patients who complied with all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the control (granisetron) group and the observed (dexamethasone) group. Randomization was performed using random number-generator, and the allocation sequence was concealed from the researcher enrolling and assessing participants in sequentially externally numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes.\nStudy procedure\nOn arrival in the operating room, standard monitoring with pulse oximetry, capnography and electrocardiog-raphy was installed, followed by insertion of an intra-\n \nRezonja et al. BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:101 	Page 3 of 10\n \n\n \narterial cannula for invasive blood pressure measure-ment. The depth of anaesthesia was followed according to the bispectral index.\nAnaesthesia was induced with propofol (1–2 mg/kg; IV) or etomidate (2 mg/kg; IV) and fentanyl (3–5 μg/kg; IV). Before administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent, their neuromuscular transmission was assessed by acceleromyography, using a TOF-Watch® SX neuromus-cular transmission monitor (Organon Ireland Ltd, Merck and Co, Inc, Swords, Dublin, Ireland), at the ulnar nerve at 15 s intervals until stabilization. During the TOF-Watch® SX calibration period, a laryngeal mask was inserted and anaesthesia was maintained with inhaled sevoflurane (minimal alveolar concentration ≥1) in an air/ oxygen mixture with intermittent positive-pressure venti-lation of the patient’s lungs to achieve a normal end-tidal carbon dioxide (4.5–5.5 kPa). Calibration of the TOF was performed according to good clinical practice guidelines [28]. Rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg; IV) was then administered, and when an adequate depth of NMB was reached (ac-cording to TOF measurements), tracheal intubation was performed, and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation continued with sevoflurane in an air/oxygen mixture with additional boluses of fentanyl (2–3 μg/kg;IV).The NMB was further assessed throughout the procedure using repetitive TOF stimulation, and IV rocuronium 0.1–0.2 mg/kg was administered accordingly, to main-tain the desired depth of NMB. This was maintained until the reversal of NMB using sugammadex (200 mg; IV), for recovery of the T4/T1 TOF ratio to ≥0.9 at the end of anaesthesia.\nAll of the patients received an antiemetic for prophy-laxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Following intubation, the patients were randomized by the opening of an opaque envelope containing a computer-generated allocation to either control group (received granisetron (1 mg; IV) at the beginning of the operation) or dexa-methasone group – these patients received dexametha-sone (0.15 mg/kg; IV) 5 min to 10 min before the administration of sugammadex. Both prior to sugamma-dex administration and after NMB reversal to TOF ≥0.9, a blood sample (4 ml) was withdrawn from the intra-arterial line. Tubes without additives were used, the samples were centrifuged, and the serum frozen at −20 °C until analysis. Determination of plasma rocuronium and dexamethasone\nconcentrations\nThe rocuronium concentrations in the plasma samples obtained from the patients in the control and dexametha-sone groups were determined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana. For this purpose, a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated according to recent recommendations for\nmethod validation in analytical toxicology [29], which were based on the International Conference on Harmonization, Harmonized Tripartite Guideline Validation of Analytical Procedures. The sugammadex–rocuronium complex disso-ciated on the chromatographic columns during the liquid chromatography, and therefore the data for rocuronium indicate the total (captured plus free) rocuronium in the plasma.\nThe plasma dexamethasone concentrations in the samples from patients in the dexamethasone group were determined at the Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, University Medical Centre Ljubljana. A competitive colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for the analyses (ID Laboratories Inc., London, Canada), with the limit of quantification of 50 μg/l, and a within-run variability of <10 %. All of these samples were analyzed as one batch.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary study endpoint was the time from sugam-madex administration to NMB reversal, measured as the recovery of muscle strength to a TOF ratio ≥0.9. The secondary endpoints were the ratios between the dexa-methasone (test group) and rocuronium concentrations (both groups) after NMB reversal to a TOF ratio >0.9 versus the dexamethasone and rocuronium con-centrations, respectively, prior to administration of sugammadex.\nDue to the lack of available literature on blood concen-trations of dexamethasone and rocuronium, sample size was determined on the basis of previous sugammadex studies [30–34] where the mean time from moderate or profound rocuronium-induced NMB to NMB reversal with a TOF ratio >0.9 was studied. We considered a 20 % increase in the time to NMB reversal to be clinically relevant. Assuming a power of 80 % for a two-sided test of difference in proportion at the 5 % significance level, and allowing for a 10 % drop-out due to protocol violation, we calculated that 33 patients per group were required.\nThe demographic data of the control and dexamethasone groups were compared using Students’ t-tests or Mann–Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, or χ2 tests for nominal variables. For paired measurements (rocuronium and dexamethasone concentrations), paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used.\nTwo models of multiple linear regression were con-structed, the first to examine the relationship between dexamethasone and the time to reversal of the rocuronium-induced NMB with sugammadex, and the second to determine whether dexamethasone affects the ratio between the rocuronium concentrations after NMB reversal versus before sugammadex administration. Beside the group (control/dexamethasone) variable, two (depth of NMB before dexamethasone administration\n \nRezonja et al. BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:101 	Page 4 of 10\n \n\n \n(baseline TOF, with TOF 1–4) and sugammadex dose) or three (depth of NMB before dexamethasone adminis-tration (baseline TOF, with TOF 1–4), sugammadex dose and rocuronium dose per hour of operation) independ-ent variables were added in the first and second regres-sion model, respectively. To meet the assumptions of the linear regression model, sugammadex dose and rocuronium dose per hour of operation were logarith-mically transformed.\nThe effects of the time interval between the two blood samples that were withdrawn and the sugammadex dose on the ratio of dexamethasone concentrations after NMB reversal versus before sugammadex administration were assessed within the dexamethasone group using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the ANOVA model, the independent variables were categorized as follows: the patients who received 2–3 mg/kg sugamma-dex vs. 3–4 mg/kg sugammadex, and the patients in whom the time between withdrawal of blood samples was ≤5 min vs. >5 min.\nResults\nBased on the power analysis, 65 patients were randomized to either the control (granisetron) or dexamethasone group, of whom 62 completed the study per protocol (Fig. 1). One patient in the control group was excluded from the study due to a surgical complication, and technical difficulties when measuring the TOF were en-countered with two patients from the dexamethasone group. In two patients among those who completed the\nstudy (one in the control and one in the dexamethasone group), a TOF ratio ≥0.8 but not ≥0.9 was reached, so these two patients were excluded from further analysis.\nThe baseline characteristics of the control and dexa-methasone groups are summarized in Table 1. There were no significant differences in these parameters between the two treatment groups.\nDexamethasone effect on time to reversal of the NMB by sugammadex\nFor the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9, there were no statistically significant differences between the control (121±61 s) and the dexamethasone group (125±57 s; P =0.760).\nThe first multiple linear regression model analysed the variables predicting the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9 and included group (control or dexamethasone), depth of NMB before sugammadex administration, and sugam-madex dose (logarithmically transformed). The model was statistically significant (P =0.049) and explained about 10 % of the population variance of the outcome (Table 2). The depth of NMB before administration of sugammadex had a statistically significant negative weight (Beta = −0.268; P =0.038), which indicated that in patients with a lower baseline TOF (before sugamma-dex administration) the time to NMB reversal to a TOF ratio ≥0.9 tended to be longer. The weights for sugammadex dose (Beta= −0.237; P =0.069) and group (control versus dexamethasone group; Beta= −0.054; P =0.676) were not statistically significantly different from zero.\n \nFig. 1 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram of study cohort.

This model was statistically signifi-cant (P =0.005) and explained about 20 % of the population variance of the outcome (Table 3). Sugam-madex dose (Beta= −0.375; P =0.004) and rocuronium dose per hour of operation (Beta= −0.366; p = 0.007) were statistically significant predictors whereas the depth of NMB before sugammadex administration (Beta= −0.089; p =0.483) and addition of dexametha-sone (Beta= −0.186; p =0.131) did not statistically sig-nificantly predict the rocuronium concentrations ratio. Analysis of factors affecting plasma dexamethasone\nconcentration\nAlthough there was a statistically significant difference (p <0.001) between the dexamethasone concentrations before sugammadex administration (810 ±283 μg/l) and\nafter NMB reversal to a TOF ratio ≥0.9 (604 ±208 μg/l, Fig. 3), ANOVA did not reveal significant effects of sugammadex dose (2–3 mg/kg (n =23) vs. 3–4 mg/kg (n =8); p = 0.729) or time between the withdrawal of blood samples (≤ n =12) vs. >5 min (n =19);\n5min(\np =0.524).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we have shown that previously ob-served in vitro interactions between sugammadex and dexamethasone [21, 22] are not reflected in the recovery from rocuronium-induced NMB by sugammadex in anesthetized patients.\nWe first quantified the possible binding of dexametha-sone to sugammadex by measuring the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9. Our results show, that the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9 is not delayed by the administration of dexamethasone before sugammadex reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB, which is in accordance with recent clinical studies by Buonanno et al. [24] and Gulec et al. [23]. In both of these studies dexamethasone was used for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Buonanno et al. retrospectively compared the effect of 8 mg dexamethasone at the induction of anesthesia or just before sugammadex adminstration on reversal time in adults [24] while Gulec et al. prospecitvely studied the\n \n\n \nTable 2 Summary of multiple regression analysis for variables predicting the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9 (n = 60)		\nB SE (B) β P-value F (df)	P-value	Adj.

This observation is in\nagreement with previous studies [38–40] and can indeed reversal time of sugammadex on rocuronium induced be explained by rapid rocuronium encapsulation by NMB in children who received 0.5 mg/kg of dexametha- sugammadex, which would create a concentration gradi-sone at the induction of anesthesia [23]. In comparison to ent that favours the movement of the remaining free these studies, we used low-dose fixed dexamethasone con- rocuronium away from the neuromuscular junction and centration (0.15 mg/kg) just prior to sugammadex admin- into the plasma. We observed that in comparison to the istration.

Box plots for the\nmeasurements of the ratios of rocuronium and dexamethasone\nconcentrations after NMB reversal (to a TOF ratio ≥0.9) to the\nrocuronium and dexamethasone concentrations, respectively, before\nsugammadex administration, in the dexamethasone group. Data are\nmedians with interquartile range\ninto clinical practice. In co-cultures of human muscle cells innervated with rat embryonic spinal cord explants, sugammadex diminished dexamethasone effects on constitutive IL-6 secretion [21], and high dexamethasone concentrations attenuated the reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB by sugammadex [22]. We can therefore assume that in human plasma, the binding between dexamethasone and sugammadex does not promote clinically significant consequences in terms of NMB re-versal delay. There could be at least two possible expla-nations for this.\nFirst, the plasma dexamethasone concentrations determined in in vivo after low-dose dexamethasone administration (0.15 mg/kg) are lower than those used in previous in vitro studies [21, 22]. The mean plasma concentration of dexamethasone (before administration of sugammadex) was approximately five times lower than dexamethasone concentration that resulted in the peak in vitro effect (10 μM). The latter had re-portedly been reached only after high-dose dexametha-sone treatment, which can be used during cardiac surgery [22, 41–45]. Hence, the sufficiently high plasma dexa-methasone concentration might be critical for its com-plexion with sugammadex.\nSecond, under in vivo conditions, there are several physiological factors that can affect the binding between dexamethasone and sugammadex that cannot be pre-dicted by in vitro conditions. This can be substantially explained by looking into the pharmacokinetics of the drugs involved. First, the greater portion of intravenous dexamethasone, 75± 4 %, is bound mainly by albumin [46] and the remainder, the unbound dexamethasone is\ntheoretically suitable for interaction with sugammadex.\nFurthermore, the apparent volume of distribution for\ndexamethasone (normalized for 70 kg bodyweight) would be 65.7±17.3 l [47], such that expected serum concentra-tion for 70 kg person (receiving altogether 10.5 mg dexa-methasone) would be 160±61 μg/l (0.4±0.2 μM), which is considerably lower than our measured mean concentra-tion just before the reversal of NMB (810 μg/l±283 μg/l, which corresponds to 2.1 μM±0.7 μM) and mean con-centration after NMB reversal to TOF ratio ≥0.9 by\nsugammadex (604±208 μg/l, which corresponds to 1.8± 0.6 μM). We therefore assume that both blood samples\nwere drawn before steady state was reached and our aim – to achieve high plasma level of dexamethasone – was\ntherefore accomplished. This allows us to speculate about the impact of higher dexamethasone doses (that could\nconceivably be used in certain clinical conditions and that\nhave also been used in in vitro studies [21, 22]) on sugam-madex reversal of NMB. To elaborate even further we can\ntake into account the pharmacokinetic profile of sugam-madex, which has a volume of distribution similar to\nextracellular fluid (11–14 l) and it does not bind to plasma\nproteins [48]. The sugammadex dose of 200 mg for a 70 kg bodyweight theoretically results in the plasma\nconcentration of 18182 – 14285 μg/l (8.3–6.6 μM). Unfor-tunately, sugammadex plasma concentration was not\ndetermined in our study and one can only speculate\nwhether these theoretical steady-state concentrations\nreflect the actual plasma concentration, especially 2 min\nafter administration. Furthermore, as previous studies\nhave demonstrated, 2 min after administration of 2 mg/kg\nsugammadex the total (rocuronium-bound and free)\nplasma concentrations of sugammadex was about 20000–\n30000 μg/l (13.8–9.2 μM) [40, 49], which is also higher\nthan theoretical steady-state concentrations. Considering\nthese calculations, and further assuming all dexametha-sone molecules would be captured by sugammadex imme-diately after its administration, about 77–85 % of surplus\nsugammadex would still remain available for rocuronium\nbinding (expected steady-state concentration for a 70 kg\nbodyweight after receiving 0.6 mg rocuronium (mean\nvolume of distribution of 14.2 l [50]) would be 2957 μg/l, which corresponds to 5.6 μM).Finally,be-sides the high protein binding properties dexametha-sone lacks the charged quaternary nitrogen on the\nammonium group of neuromuscular blocking agents\nthat binds to the carboxyethyl side chains of sugam-madex [51]. This explains the aforementioned low\nassociation rate constant between dexamethasone and\nsugammadex (less than 1000 mol/l) in contrast to\nhigh rocuronium-sugammadex association rate constant\n(1.79×107 mol/l) [26] and further supports assumption that clinically important NMB delay due to dexametha-sone would be highly unlikely.\n \nRezonja et al. BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:101 	Page 8 of 10\n \n\n \nNevertheless, we cannot extrapolate our findings on corti-costeroids in general. Namely, study by Zwiers et al. has re-vealed that dexamethasone shows the lowest displacement potential among corticosteroids [26], so based on the present and previous studies [21–24] the clinically relevant interactions between sugammadex and other corticosteroids cannot be excluded and further studies are required.\nWhen interpreting our findings, one should take into consideration the limitations of the study. As already men-tioned, sample size was determined on the basis of previ-ous sugammadex studies [30–34] instead of conducting a preliminary study. Next, the sugammadex dose was not ad-justed to depth of NMB (TOF count), but was rather gen-eralized to all patients (one vial, 200 mg), which was then later calculated to mg/kg sugammadex for statistical ana-lysis. To compensate for this, the data were analyzed using a regression model to adjust for different sugammadex concentrations. Furthermore, enrolment of another group of patients in whom NMB reversal would be promoted by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (and not by sugammadex) would have helped us distinguish between the decrement in dexamethasone concentration due to its re-distribution to peripheral compartments and to the decrement attribut-able to its complexing with sugammadex.\nRegarding the choice of the TOF ratio ≥0.9 threshold, it should be noted that we could have analyzed complete data without excluding the two patients who had not reached the threshold. The simplest approach would be to assign the maximum observed time (optionally increased by a small random value) to those two patients. A more valid approach would be to analyze the data as censored, e.g., using a Cox regression model. We tried both approaches and obtained essentially identical results to those reported (in terms of statistical significance of the model as a whole as well as of the individual predictors). The ef-fect of omitting the two patients was therefore negli-gible, so we opted for using the established threshold and applying a simpler data-analysis method.\nConclusions\nTo conclude, the addition of dexamethasone in anesthe-tized patients did not delay NMB reversal by sugammadex. Although we observed a drop in plasma dexamethasone and a rise in plasma rocuronium concentrations after sugammadex administration, this did not appear to be a direct consequence of the displacement interaction between dexamethasone and sugammadex. Therefore, the significant interaction between dexamethasone and sugammadex that has been previously demonstrated in in vitro biological models was not confirmed in anesthetized patients in vivo, probably due to several intrinsic factors that influence pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of both dexa-methasone and rocuronium. The interaction is therefore limited to such extent that is clinically irrelevant.\nAbbreviations\nANOVA: Analysis of variance; ANZCTR: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry; ASA: American Society of Anaesthesiologists; IL-6: Interlekukin 6; LC-MS/MS: Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry;\nNMB: Neuromuscular block; TOF: Train-of-four; TOFr: Train-of four ratio Funding\nThis research was funded by University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe dataset supporting the conclusions of this article is available on request by contacting the first or corresponding author.\nAuthors’ contributions\nKR designed and conducted the study, analyzed the data, drafted the\nmanuscript and is the author responsible for archiving the study files.

Neuromuscular conduction that is not completely improved leads to post-operative residual curarisation and \nthe development of complications that are related to respiration (1, 2). \n \nTe use of neostigmine, which is a cholinesterase inhibitor, is a standard procedure for the reversal of the efect of neuromus-\ncular blockers, but some side efects, such as slowed heart rate, increased secretion and bronchospasm, make its use more \ndifcult (3, 4). In contrast, anti-cholinergic drugs, including atropine and glycopyrrolate, which are used for preventing these \nside efects, increase the frequency of arrhythmia and cause blurred vision and sedation (4). Sugammadex, which is a new agent \nfor the reversal of neuromuscular blockade, is a modifed gamma-cyclodextrin. It forms a complex with rocuronium, removes \nit from the circulation and terminates neuromuscular blockade (5). Sugammadex is a safe agent with a low risk of serious side \nefects (6). Te high cost of sugammadex, which is one of the most expensive drugs in anaesthesia practice, prevents it from \nbeing used as a standard neuromuscular reversal drug (7). Although it has been suggested that the cost of sugammadex use in \nanaesthesia can be reduced by shortening the duration of recovery (8), further clinical studies on sugammadex are required (9). \n \nObstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that is characterised by pauses in breathing during sleep \nbecause of the obstruction of the upper respiratory tract (10).

Te risk of developing perioperative \ncomplications has increased in patients with OSA. Tis is \ntrue both for patients who are operated for OSA and for pa-\ntients who are operated for any other reason but have OSA \nas a co-morbidity (11-15). It has been reported that OSA is \nan independent risk factor for the development of pulmo-\nnary complications and the requirement for post-operative \nmechanical ventilation (11). It can be suggested that the \ncomplete and rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade will \ndecrease both the frequency of complications and costs in \npatients with high risk for post-operative respiratory system \ncomplications.\nTis study aims to evaluate the use of sugammadex and \nneostigmine/atropine in patients who were operated for \nOSA, the efciency of sugammadex in antagonising the ef-\nfect of rocuronium, its efect on the frequency of developing \npost-operative respiratory system complications and its cost. \nMethods\nTis prospective randomised study was conducted in the \nDışkapı Yıldırım Beyazıt Training and Research Hospital \nafter receiving ethical approval from the Erciyes University \nClinical Research Ethics Committee and written informed \nconsent from patients. Te study included patients who were \noperated for the treatment of OSA and who were in the ASA \nphysiology classes I and II and in the age group ranging from \n19 to 65 years. Patients with known hypersensitivity to the \nstudy drugs, those on medications that would interact with \nmuscle relaxants and patients having neuromuscular, respi-\nratory, liver and renal diseases, morbid obese, pregnant and \nlactating patients were excluded. Te patients’ age, gender, \nbody mass index and apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) were \nrecorded. \nthermia was maintained during the intervention. Initial heart rate (HR), systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and SpO values were recorded. \n2\nTe monitorization of neuromuscular activity was performed from the adductor pollicis muscle via an acceleromyogra-phy technique (TOF WatchR SX, Schering Plough, Dublin, Ireland) according to the Good Clinical Research Practice in Pharmacodynamic Studies of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents guidelines (16). For monitoring neuromuscular ac-tivity, the forearm was previously cleaned with alcohol and fxed on an arm board before anaesthesia induction. Elec-trodes were placed on the ulnar nerve trace and an accel-eration transducer was placed on the distal phalanx of the thumb. Te other four fngers were fxed in a fat position. Neuromuscular conduction data and skin temperature in the hypothenar region were monitored using a TOF Watch SX. \n−1\nFor anaesthesia induction, 1.5–2.5 mg kg propofol was used and then calibration was performed by acceleromyographic train of four (TOF; 0.2 ms time, 50 mA current, 2 Hz fre-quency). TOF stimuli, repeated at 15-s intervals, were con-tinued until the end of the intervention. During calibration, patients were administered inhaled oxygen. Endotracheal intubation was performed after providing muscle relaxation with rocuronium and TOF 0.1 was obtained. Cormack–Le-hane scores of patients were recorded. \nDesfurane in a mixture of oxygen (40%) and nitrous ox-ide (60%) was used for maintaining anaesthesia. Te depth of anaesthesia was titrated in such a way that the BIS value would be 40–60. Controlled positive-pressure ventilation was applied to provide an EtCO value of 30–36 mmHg. Et-\n2\nDes was recorded. When a response to the second TOF stim-ulus (T2) was obtained from patients, they were administered \n−1\n0.15 mg kg rocuronium. Te total doses of muscle relaxants were recorded. For post-operative pain control, patients were intravenously administered 1 g paracetamol 15 min before the end of the operation. \n \n\n \n	Patients were divided into two groups by random selection 	At the end of surgery, rocuronium was antagonised within \n	using numbered envelopes.

Teir HR values, SpO values, blood pressures and re-\n2\nspiratory rates were measured at 5-min intervals. In the PACU the muscle strength was clinically monitored. \nPost-operative pain was evaluated using an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) for pain (0=no pain and 10=the most se-vere pain ever felt). When the VAS pain score was >3, dex-ketoprofen (25 mg i.v.) was administered as an additional analgesic agent. \nPatients were monitored both after extubation and in PACU and intensive care unit (ICU) with regard to complications. Complications associated with respiration were defned as cough, breath holding, increased secretion, desaturation (SpO ≤90), laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypoxaemia \n2\n(PaO <60), apnoea and pulmonary disorders (atelectasis, \n2\npneumonia and others). Complications related to circulation were hypertension (MAP >20% above initial value), hypo-tension (MAP >20% below initial value), tachycardia (HR >20% above initial value), bradycardia (HR≤45 beats min−1), rhythm disturbances that were not previously present and car-diac arrest. For treating respiration-related complications, the procedures of administering oxygen with a mask, airway ma-nipulation, airway placement and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask ventilation were implemented. In case of no improvement in hypoxaemia despite these therapies, re-intubation, admission to the ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) were performed. Hypertension that lasted for >1 min was treated with nitroglycerin infusion; a 250-mL fuid bolus or 5 mg ephedrine; tachycardia with esmolol infu-sion and bradycardia with 0.5 mg atropine. Patients with an Aldrete score of ≥9 were referred to the clinic. \nPatients whose Aldrete score was <9 despite close monitoring and treatment in PACU for 1 h were transferred to ICU. Un-planned admissions to ICU, pulmonary complications (at-electasis, pneumonia and others), blood gas analyses during follow-up, blood biochemistry evaluation, chest radiography and other unplanned procedures, CPAP, IMV treatments and parenteral antibiotic therapies were recorded. \nA static model that included the cost of reversal agents, other administred drugs and therapies anaesthesia doctor and anaes-thesia nurse costs, hospitalisation in ICU and the treatment of complications (8, 17). According to this model;\nComplication treatment cost=frequency of complica-\ntions×cost of 1st -\n day, cost of complication treatment and lab\noratory test and imaging (blood gases, blood biochemistry, \nchest radiography and other unplanned procedures, mechan-\nical ventilation, parenteral antibiotic therapy)+cost of ICU \non other days.\nCosts per minute were calculated using information regard-\ning the monthly incomes of anaesthesia doctor and nurse \ntheir pension contributions and their weekly working hours. \nTe Healthcare Application Regulation (HAR) was taken as \na basis for the cost of arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, ex-\namination of whole blood, blood biochemistry analysis, me-\nchanical ventilation, hospitalisation in ICU/day and paren-\nteral antibiotic therapy, and public cost was calculated. \nTe primary outcome measure of the study is the time to ob-\ntain a TOF 0.9 after the administration of the reversal agent. \nTe secondary outcome measures are the operation room \ntime, PACU time, frequency of respiratory and circulatory \ncomplications and cost (reversal, anaesthesia care, complica-\ntion treatment).\nStatistical analysis\nData were statistically analysed using IBM Statistical Package \nfor the Social Sciences for Windows version 21.0 software \n(IBM SPSS Statics, New York, USA). Numerical variables \nwere summarised as mean±standard deviation and median \n[minimum−maximum] values. Categorical variables were \nshown as numbers and percentage values. Te normality of \nnumerical variables was determined by the Shapiro–Wilk \ntest, and the homogeneity of variances was determined \nby Levene’s test. Te presence of a diference between two \ngroups in terms of numerical variables was investigated with a \nt-test in independent groups when parametric test conditions \nwere provided. In contrast, when these conditions could not \nbe provided, the diference was investigated using the Mann–\nWhitney U test. Te chi-square test was used for determining \nthe presence of a diference between the groups in terms of \ncategorical variables. Te signifcance level was accepted to \nbe a p value of <0.05. Te size of the sample was determined \nto be 37 patients in each group (power 0.95 and type 1 error \n0.05) on the basis of the diference in durations in PACU \nthat was found in a preliminary investigation (group 1, mean \n24.1±3.2 min and group 2, mean 40.7±29.9 min).\nResults\n \nTe study was completed with 74 patients.

This has been replicated by others in various abdominal and non-abdominal proce-dures [5±9]. Moreover, a high-dose rocuronium NMB effectively precludes unexpected\ndeterioration of the surgical field at any time [3±9]. Prevention of sudden patient movements is important during critical procedures, such as ophthalmic and neuro-radiologic intervention procedures. Additionally, recent data suggest that high-dose rocuronium NMB may improve pain scores after laparoscopic surgery [4], although this is not a consistent finding [3,10].\nAlthough tightly controlled randomized trials have shown improved subjective scores of\nsurgical conditions when using high-dose rocuronium NMB, there is little evidence that the use of a high-dose rocuronium NMB improves outcome such as reduced postoperative pain\nscores or less postoperative surgical complications. In addition, the use of muscle relaxants during anesthesia is associated with postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade and respi-ratory complications [11,12]. Therefore, the intraoperative benefits of high-dose rocuronium NMB during surgery must be weighed against possible postoperative complications. Cur-rently, one possible strategy to prevent residual NMB induced by high-dose rocuronium NMB is reversal with sugammadex, a rocuronium- and vecuronium-specific reversal agent that has been associated in previous studies with a reduction in the incidence of postoperative respira-tory complications [13,14]. However, the cost of sugammadex is a consideration and the cost benefit of high-dose rocuronium NMB has therefore been questioned due to uncertain effect on outcomes and high cost of reversal [15].\nGiven the results of the majority of studies showing improved surgical conditions during\nhigh-dose rocuronium NMB, we routinely apply such a NMB in close coordination with our\nsurgical colleagues since July 2015. The high-dose rocuronium NMB is now as part of our clini-cal practice in a variety of surgical procedures including laparoscopic abdominal procedures, eye surgery and neuroradiological interventions. To understand the utility of high-dose rocuro-nium anesthesia under ªreal worldº conditions and to address the above-mentioned gap in the evidence on outcomes, we performed a retrospective analysis of chart data to compare high-dose versus low-dose rocuronium administration in patients undergoing laparoscopic retroperi-toneal surgery. In the analysis we focused on unplanned 30-day readmission rates. Unplanned 30-day readmission is a quality measure of patient care and is costly [16±18]. Previous studies\nshowed that an important factor associated with unplanned readmission is surgical complexity, with infectious complications being the most common indication for readmission [16,19±21]. We hypothesized that the intraoperative advantage created by high-dose rocuronium (i.e. high-dose rocuronium NMB) may ultimately translate into less unplanned readmissions within the 30 days following the elective surgical procedure. The choice of focusing on laparoscopic retro-peritoneal surgery is based on the fact that in our institution the majority of general anesthetics with high-dose relaxant is applied for these procedures as they benefit the most from high-dose rocuronium NMB compared to other laparoscopic procedures [3].\n \nMethods\n \nHigh-dose rocuronium NMB was applied using a standard operating procedure that was\nintroduced in July 2015 in our hospital for a series of procedures unless contraindicated (e.g.\n \nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197036	May 23, 2018	2 / 12\n \nHigh-dose rocuronium and unplanned readmission\n \nallergies to rocuronium or sugammadex, an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min).\nThe high-dose rocuronium NMB is induced by an induction dose of rocuronium (1 mg/kg), fol-\nlowed by a continuous infusion (range 20±50 mg/h) aimed at a post-tetanic count of 1±2 as mea-\nsured by the TOF CUFF monitor system. After approval of the protocol by the local institutional\nreview board (Commissie Medische Ethiek, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden,\nThe Netherlands) and registration at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03174223), fully anonymized data of\npatients that received anesthesia from January 2014 to December 2016 were retrieved from two\nelectronic medical record databases (Healthcare Information X-change (HIX) and Patient Data\nManagement System (PDMS) both from Chipsoft, The Netherlands). The electronic databases\nwere searched for cases that received general anesthesia with high-dose rocuronium by continu-\nous infusion for any type of elective procedure by using HIX and PDMS specific queries. High-\ndose rocuronium was defined by a 1 mg/kg bolus dose at induction followed by a continuous\ninfusion. Next, we identified cases that received high-dose rocuronium from July 2015 to\nDecember 2016 were matched (one-on-one) for type of surgery, sex, age and American Society\nof Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification to a case that had received general anes-\nthesia with low-dose rocuronium from January 2014 to July 2015. Low-dose rocuronium was\ndefined by a 0.4 mg/kg bolus dose at induction and absent continuous infusion during surgery.\nThe matching was performed on type of surgery, sex, age (ages could differ by a maximum of 4\nyears) and ASA status (ASA class 1 and 2 were combined into one group). The research team\nchecked and validated the data manually for consistency and accuracy.\nThe following data were compared between high- and low dose rocuronium NMB: (1)\npatient-related data, including age, sex, weight, body mass index (BMI) and ASA physical status\nclassification; (2) data related to anesthesia and surgery, including surgery type, hemodynamics\n(blood pressure and heart rate; average of values collected during surgery), depth of anesthesia\nas measured by bispectral index monitoring (average of values collected during surgery), drugs\nadministered and their dose, duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, postoperative pain\nscores (measured on an 11-point verbal rating scale (VRS) from 0, no pain to 10, worst imagin-\nable pain); (3) immediate respiratory complications as defined by hypoxemic events in the\nPACU (SpO < 90%), bronchospasm, pneumonia during hospital stay; (4) admissions to inten-\n2\nsive or intermediate care departments during hospital stay; (4) thirty-day unplanned readmis-\nsion data (cause of readmission, duration of readmission and relevant patient data of readmitted\ncases); (5) cost of relaxation and reversal. Pain scores were obtained in the post-anesthesia care\nunit (PACU) at 15 min intervals and on the ward three-times daily. The pain data were averaged\nfor location (i.e. average pain data obtained at the PACU and on the ward).\nData were analyzed comparing the high-dose relaxant versus low-dose relaxant groups by\npaired-t-test, Mann-Whitney U test or χ2 test, depending on the type of data and data distribu-\ntion. Data are presented as mean ± SD or median or interquartile range (IQR); p-values < 0.05\nwere considered significant. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.00\nfor MAC OS X (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).\nThe primary outcome of our study was the incidence of unplanned readmission within\n30-days of the elective surgical procedure; secondary outcome was cost of relaxation and rever-\nsal in the high-and low-dose rocuronium cohorts. Additionally, we compared duration of sur-\ngery and anesthesia, and postoperative pain between cohorts.\n \nResults\nPatients and procedures\n \nDuring the search period 51,000 anesthetics were administered for various procedures at Lei-\nden University Medical Center. The initial selection procedure resulted in 537 cases that were\n \nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197036	May 23, 2018	3 / 12\n \nHigh-dose rocuronium and unplanned readmission\n \nconsidered eligible for inclusion in the analysis. High-dose rocuronium anesthesia was admin-\nistered most frequently to patients undergoing urological procedures, ophthalmologic surgery\nor surgical renal procedures. During the manual validation process 407 cases were excluded\nfor the following reasons: age < 18 years, lack of surgical procedure code, multiple patient\ninputs, missing time stamps, absence of reversal dosing information, or procedures other than\nelective laparoscopic retroperitoneal surgeries (these procedures included open eye surgeries\n(n = 77), gastrointestinal surgery (n = 14), organ transplantations (n = 15), neurosurgical pro-\ncedures (n = 4) and gynecological procedures (n = 1)). The final data set consisted of 130 cases\nthat received high-dose rocuronium in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic retroperito-\nneal surgery. Matching was successful in 100% of cases yielding a total of 130 cases that on\naverage received 217 ± 49 mg rocuronium and 130 matched cases that received 37 ± 5 mg.\nPatient characteristics and surgical procedures are given in Table 1. Patients in the two cohorts\nhad similar age, ASA classification, weight and body mass index. Due to the predominance of\nurology in our cohort, males were in the majority (in each cohort 98 men and 32 women). Glo-\nmerular filtration rate was above 30 mL/min in all patients receiving high-dose rocuronium\nand in 125 patients receiving low-dose rocuronium.\n \nAnesthesia and surgery\n \nThe two study cohorts differed by a factor of 6 in the amount of rocuronium that was adminis-\ntered (Table 2; S1 Fig). For induction and maintenance all patients received propofol com-\nbined with remifentanil, sufentanil or both. More patients in the high-dose relaxant group\nreceived remifentanil (65% vs. 33%) at on average a 20% higher dose compared to patients in\nthe low-dose relaxant group (p = 0.015, Table 2).

A total of 130 patients who received high-dose\nrocuronium anesthesia (and reversal with sugammadex) were compared to 130 matched\npatients that received low-dose rocuronium anesthesia (to induce a moderate NMB). The\nmain finding of this study is that the administration of high-dose rocuronium is associated\nwith reduced unplanned readmission rates in the thirty days following elective surgery (3.8%\nvs. 12.7%). Furthermore, the application of high-dose rocuronium anesthesia was without\ninadvertent admissions to intensive or intermediate care departments.\nNeuromuscular blocking agents are routinely used in anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal\nintubation and improve surgical conditions [1,2]. A recent meta-analysis of 12 randomized\ncontrolled trials concluded that high-dose rocuronium NMB (causing a so-called deep NMB\nwith PTC 1±3) improves surgical conditions in a variety of procedures as determined by\nthe scoring of the surgical space conditions by the attending surgeon [22]. In most studies\nincluded in this review, the applied scoring systems combine the impression of visibility, surgi-\ncal space, muscle contractions, handling tactics and patient movement into one numerical rat-\ning score. In all studies, the effect of the high-dose rocuronium NMB on the score is modest\n(on average the score improves by about 20%) but considered highly clinically significant by\nthe surgical team [3,4]. Still, the risk of postoperative complications from residual NMB has\nhistorically precluded the use of high dose relaxants for many years [11,12]. With the introduc-\ntion of sugammadex, reversal of high-dose rocuronium NMB is now possible [13,23]. In our\ninstitute we now apply high-dose rocuronium anesthesia upon request of surgeons to allow a\nstable and qualitatively superior surgical space conditions in a variety of procedures.\nOur current analysis shows that the both cohorts did not differ in hemodynamics, duration\nof surgery and anesthesia or immediate postoperative conditions, including postoperative pain.\nA small difference in depth of anesthesia and mean arterial pressure was observed although we\ndo not consider these differences clinically relevant. We previously identified a small positive\neffect of high-dose rocuronium NMB on postoperative pain scores following bariatric surgery\nbut not following retroperitoneal urologic procedures [3,4]. The above mentioned meta-analysis\nof 12 studies also revealed a small advantage of high-dose rocuronium NMB over standard or\nlow-dose rocuronium NMB with an improvement in postoperative numerical pain scores of 0.5\non an 11-point scale [22]. These data suggest that the effect of high-dose rocuronium NMB on\npain scores is small. Different procedures may activate specific pathophysiologic pain pathways\nthat interact differently with the high-dose rocuronium NMB. In the current analysis we focus\non retroperitoneal surgeries. These procedures are associated with relatively low pain scores\nand little effect of high-dose rocuronium NMB [3]. Hence, our analysis does not allow definite\nconclusions regarding the influence of high-dose rocuronium NMB on postoperative pain.\nWe encountered a reduction in unplanned readmission rates from 12.7% in the low-dose to\n3.8% in the high-dose rocuronium cohort (Table 4). Readmissions after surgery are relatively\ncommon, with rates ranging from 4±16% after major urologic surgery and 9±20% after colo-\nrectal surgery [24,25]. Readmission after surgery represents a major cost for the health care\nsystem. For instance, readmission after colorectal surgery costs $9000 per readmission; this\nannually accounts for $300 million in the US alone [26]. To address and reduce costs, readmis-\nsion is increasingly being used as a hospital quality indicator by reimbursement agencies. In\n \nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197036	May 23, 2018	7 / 12\n \nHigh-dose rocuronium and unplanned readmission\n \nthe US, as a part of the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, reimbursements may be\ndenied in case of excessive readmission rates [27]. The cost of readmission to reimbursement\nagencies in our institute is approximately $8,300 per patient. Given the reduction in readmis-\nsions observed in patients receiving high-dose rocuronium anesthesia (combined with sugam-\nmadex reversal) compared to patients receiving low-dose rocuronium anesthesia, there is a\npotential financial benefit to the healthcare system that could offset the costs associated with\nhigh doses of rocuronium and sugammadex made by the hospital. As this retrospective data\nmay be biased due to changes in surgical and/or anesthesia practice over time, possible inaccu-\nracies in the dataset or its retrieval from HIX or PDMS or other relevant limitations (see\nbelow), a prospective randomized pharmacoeconomic trial should be considered to definitely\ncapture relevant cost data.\nKnown risk factors for readmission include older age, comorbid conditions, length of pro-\ncedure, surgery complexity, intra- and postoperative complications [16±19,20,21,28]. Due to\nmatching, in our study all relevant factors were comparable at baseline (Tables 1 and 2). We\ntherefore account the application of high-dose rocuronium anesthesia as the most important\nfactor associated with the lower readmission rates. Although our study does not answer the\nquestion why better chemical relaxation results in improved surgical outcome, we believe that\nit is important to discuss possible mechanisms. All procedures were performed in the retroper-\nitoneal space, where working space is very limited. As previously shown, high-dose rocuro-\nnium NMB leads to superior scoring of the surgical space conditions in these retroperitoneal\nsurgeries [3,22]. Possibly, the improved surgical conditions in the narrow space of retroperito-\nneal laparoscopic surgery during high-dose rocuronium NMB contribute to superior technical\nperformance of the surgeon and less trauma to tissue. A recent review supports this hypothesis\nby concluding that superior technical performance positively affects patient outcome [29]. An\nimportant reason for readmission was an infectious complication of the urinary tract (compli-\ncated urinary tract infection including pyelonephritis and urosepsis). We hypothesize that uri-\nnary tract tissue is particularly susceptible to infection when surgical space conditions are less\noptimal and/or urinary tract tissue is more frequently or more intensely manipulated (causing\nmicro traumata). Additionally, it is important to realize that NMB agents possess anti-inflam-\nmatory properties through actions at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α1 [30]. The high-\ndose rocuronium infusion may therefore have had some tissue protective effect leading to less\npostoperative complications. Reduced glomerular filtration rate (chronic kidney disease, CKD,\nstage 4 and 5 with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min) affects rocuronium clearance.\nThis may be a cause of residual NMB and postoperative complications, especially in those\npatients that are not or inadequately monitored. However in patients with complications that\nrequired readmission just 1 patient receiving low-dose rocuronium and none receiving high-\ndose rocuronium had CKD stage 5 (Table 4). The reason for readmission in this one particular\npatient was severe enteritis and a transient ischemic attack. Consequently, we do not think\nthat renal function influenced the outcome of our study. Finally, in other surgery types such as\nophthalmology, we did not observe a difference in readmission rates (data not shown). This\nsuggests that the improved outcome in our study is most importantly related to the type and\nsite of surgery.\nOur study has various limitations that need to be considered:\n \n1.	Since the use of high-dose rocuronium anesthesia is relatively new to our clinical practice, we were able to just include a small number of patients in our analysis. This small sample\nprecluded the analysis of underlying contributing risk factors as a cause of readmission.\n \n\n \n2.	We remain unaware whether the results of our study are related to the high-dose rocuro-nium infusion, the reversal with sugammadex or to both. The number of patients that\n \n\n \nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197036	May 23, 2018	8 / 12\n \nHigh-dose rocuronium and unplanned readmission\n \nreceived sugammadex in the low-dose rocuronium cohort was too small to perform a sepa-\nrate analysis.\n \n3.	This is a single-center study and generalizability to other centers is likely to be limited. For example, the use of a rocuronium infusion (and reversal with sugammadex) is not standard care in other hospitals in Europe or the US.\n \n\n \n4.	This is a non-randomized study with a non-contemporaneous control group. We cannot\nexclude that temporal changes in anesthesia or surgical care may have contributed to the study outcome.\n \n\n \n5.	More subjects in the high-dose rocuronium group received the opioid remifentanil and\nirrespective of the type of opioid, the opioid dose was higher in the high-dose rocuronium group. This is a surprising observation that so far remains unexplained. We do not perceive a role for the difference in opioid dose in our study outcome, although it might explain the slightly deeper levels of anesthesia in the high-dose rocuronium cohort (Table 3).\n \n\n \n6.	Our dataset lacks complete TOF data, as TOF measurements are not automatically recorded in our electronic patient database system. Although neuromuscular monitoring\ndevices are available in all our operating rooms and monitoring is mandatory by local pro-tocols, it cannot be ruled out that part of the patients were in fact inadequately or not moni-tored, especially in the low dose rocuronium group. This may be a source of residual\nconfounding, however to what extent this influenced our study remains unclear.\n \nEvidently, further prospective randomized controlled trials (with appropriate monitoring)\nin larger populations are required to determine causal inferences between the relaxant dose\nand patient outcome and a possible role for the reversal agent on patient outcome.\nIn conclusion, this small retrospective study presents the first real world data of the effect of\na high-dose rocuronium/sugammadex anesthetic technique on postoperative outcome. Our\ndata indicate that the use of a high-dose rocuronium/sugammadex technique is associated\nwith reduced readmission rates in the thirty days following elective laparoscopic retroperito-\nneal surgery compared to low-dose rocuronium infusions. Given the study limitations, future\nprospective randomized studies in larger samples are needed to further investigate the benefit\nof high-dose relaxants on patient outcome. Additionally, the prospective study of the pharma-\ncoeconomic effect of such practice taking into account benefit (reduced readmission rates)\nand harm (cost of relaxants and reversal agents) is imminently needed.\n \nSupporting information\n \nS1 File.

Intraoperative care\nThe patient\'s premedication involved the administration of 0.5 mg of lorazepam 60 minutes before arrival in the operating theater. The anesthesia equipment consisted of a 3-lead electro-cardiogram, a noninvasive blood pressure measurement device, and ﬁngerpulse oximetry.An intravenous line containing Ring-er\'s lactate solution was inserted into a major left forearm vein.\nWeuseda quantitativeneuromusculartransmission(NMT) monitor to guide rocuronium administration continuously in every patient, from NMB induction to tracheal extubation. Using electromyography, the adductor pollicis responses were recorded after ulnar nerve stimulation (NeuroMuscular Trans-mission module; GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) ac-cording to good clinical research guidelines [12].TOF stimulations were applied every 20 seconds. When the TOF count was 0, a posttetanic count was determined every 5 minutes.\nAnesthesia was induced with intravenous sufentanil at\n 1, ketamine at 0.5 mg • kg 1\n0.15 μg•kg , and propofol at 2 to 3 mg • kg 1\nand immediately maintained with a minimum of 6% desﬂurane to a target minimal alveolar concentration of 1 to 1.2 according toneed(Zeus Inﬁnity–empoweredanesthe-sia machine; Drägerwerk AG and Co, Lübeck, Germany). After the patient lostconsciousness, the ventilation was manu-ally controlled. The randomized dose of rocuronium was then administered, and tracheal intubation was performed once the evoked muscular responses ceased (TOF count 0). Controlled mechanical ventilation was initiated (semiclosed circuit, 40%-45% oxygen in air) and adjusted to produce an end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration within the range of 30 to 35 mm Hg. After the patient had been placed in the lithotomic position, we determined the hemodynamic baseline before the surgicalprocedurebegan.Duringthestudyperiod,theoropha-ryngeal and right-hand temperatures were maintained above 36°C and 32°C, respectively. The intraperitoneal CO insuf-\n2 ﬂation pressure was set and monitored at 13 mm Hg through-out the procedure. The patient was placed in the maximal Trendelenburg position at 45° for the duration of the surgery\n(Maquet, Ardon, France). Postoperative pain and nausea were prevented via the administration of 1 g of paracetamol,\n 1 of tramadol, 50 mg of alizapride, and 0.625 mg 1mg•kg\nof dehydrobenzperidol 30 minutes before the end of surgery. We added 10 mg of butylhyoscine to prevent spasms on the urinary catheter. At the end of the surgery, the abdominal cav-ity was completely exsufﬂated, and the abdominal ports were removed. No further rocuronium bolus was administered. The patient was placed ﬂat, the laparoscopic incisions were su-tured, and the skin was dressed. The NMB reversal agent was administered depending on the group and the level of NMB recovery. The effects of pharmacologic reversal were monitoreduntilaTOFratiogreaterthan0.9wasobtained;then theadministrationofdesﬂuranewasinterrupted,andthevapor was washed out rapidly (Zeus 1-minute wash-out during me-chanical ventilation followed by fresh gas ﬂow N10 L/min O 95% in air in spontaneous breathing mode) [13]. All pa-\n2\ntientswereextubatedaftertherecoveryofspontaneousbreath-ing, swallowing, and airway protection reﬂexes. The monitors were removed, and the patients were transferred to the PACU with oxygen.\nWe recorded the duration of the surgery (T1), the duration of NMB reversal—from the injection of the reversal agent un-til a TOF ratio of 0.9 was achieved—(T2), the time between the end of surgery and OR discharge (T3), and the total time spent in the OR (T4).\n2.5. Postanesthesia care unit\nIn the PACU, nurses who were blinded to the study group evaluated the patients\' recoveries on arrival and every 15 mi-nutes, using a modiﬁed Aldrete score that included 7 items, each of which counted for 2 points, as described in Table 1 [14-16]. When needed (ie, when the visual analog score was N3), intravenousmorphine(1 mg)wasadministered every5mi-nutes to alleviate pain. Ondansetron (4 mg) was added in cases of mild postoperative nausea or vomiting. After a minimum of 30 minutes, the patients were declared ready for discharge if their recovery score was N12andeveryitemwasundercontrol.\n \n110	L.

Despite this, the proper reversal of moderate to deep\n	NMB with sugammadex (2-4 mg • kg 1) was not only faster\n	than reversal with neostigmine (at moderate or much higher\n	NMB levels) but also more predictable, as demonstrated by a\n	much lower standard deviation (1.15 vs 15.43 minutes). This\n	beneﬁt was reﬂected in more rapid OR discharges. The time\n	spent in the OR between the end of surgery and discharge\n	was shorter on average, as has been previously published [4],\n	and also more predictable when sugammadex was used\n	(Fig. 2).

Previous studies have demonstrated that residual\n	NMB on arrival to the PACU is associated with delayed dis-\n	charge [27]. Our protocol imposed the criteria of the recovery\n	of a TOF ratio N0.9 on both groups before awakening and\n	extubating the patients, which ruled out the residual block\n	and its potential inﬂuence on PACU initial recovery assessments\n	and staydurations. In these conditions, reversal with sugammadex\n	did not further favor better recovery scores compared with neo-\n	stigmine. The lack of differences between groups in the PACU\n	could be related to improved management of residual NMB in\n	the OR for every patient, based on quantitative NMT monitoring.\n	The postoperative factors that most frequently contributed\n	to the time spent in the PACU were the need for supplemental\n	pain management (visual analog score N3 in 54% of the pa-\n	tients), hypoxemia, hypotension, insufﬁcient consciousness\n	recovery, and postoperative nausea or vomiting (see Table 3).\n	However, there was no signiﬁcant difference between groups.\n	This ﬁnding conﬁrms recent studies that have been conducted\n	in the same context and compared recovery from deep\n	NMB + sugammadex vs moderate NMB + neostigmine after\n	laparoscopic surgery [4,18,28].\n	Thetranslation ofthepossiblebeneﬁtsofNMBreversedby\nFig. 2 OR discharge.

A forced vital capacity less than 30%\nsuggests higher respiratory complication rate [53],\nbut spinal surgery has been successful in this set-\n&&\nting [20 ]. DMD is associated with delayed gastric\nemptying. Scoliosis may make airway manage-\nment difficult [4]. Succinylcholine is contraindi-\ncated secondary to the risk of hyperkalemia,\nrhabdomyolysis, and cardiac arrest; rapid\nsequence induction with rocuronium has been\nreported [25]. Volatile anesthetics are associated\nwith anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis (AIR),\nhyperkalemia, and cardiac arrest [54–57]. AIR is\noften confused for malignant hyperthermia and is\ntreated the same [58,59]. TIVA is the preferred\nmethod of general anesthesia [5]. Sugammadex\nhas been used successfully [25]. Sedation and\nregional anesthesia are well tolerated in DMD\n[60&,61,62]. ICU admission and postoperative\nintubation may be required [63–65].\nBECKER’S MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY\nSimilar to DMD, BMD is an X-linked recessive dis-\norder of the dystrophin gene. It is less severe and\nlater presentation than DMD [66]. It affects 1 in\n18450 and patients are wheelchair bound by age\n16 [67&]. Cardiopulmonary dysfunction is common\n&].\n[68 Anesthetic considerations and management\nare similar to DMD [27,69].\nMYASTHENIA GRAVIS\nMyasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder\ncausedbyantibodiestothepostsynapticacetylecho-\nline receptors at the NMJ, resulting in weakness [70].\nThe prevalence is 1.5–2.5 per 10000 [71]. Weakness\ncan be localized (bulbar) or generalized, worsens\nwith repetition, and eye muscles are affected [72].\nDiagnosis is clinical and antibody detection is con-\nfirmatory, but there are also seronegative patients\n[73,74]. Outpatient therapy includes acetylcholin-\nesterase inhibitors and immunosuppression. Thy-\nmectomy is common for patients both with and\nwithout thymoma [75]. Myasthenia during preg-\nnancy has an unpredictable course and can compli-\ncate labor, delivery, and newborn well being[76,77].\nLife-threatening exacerbations are treated with\nimmunoglobulin and plasma exchange [9&&].\nPerioperative management of myasthenia gravis is challenging. Emphasis is placed on NMB manage-ment and possible postoperative ventilation [78&]. Disease severity and respiratory/bulbar compromise should be documented. PFTs should be performed and thymomas are anterior mediastinal masses\n&].\n[79 Postoperative ventilation is more likely in patients with preoperative respiratory/bulbar dys-function and Osserman disease severity scale III or IV (Table 3) [80,81].\nIntraoperative general anesthesia has been suc-cessful with multiple modalities including inhala-tional, TIVA, and combined general-epidural [82– 88]. The neuromuscular blocking effects of volatile\nanesthetics is exaggerated in myasthenia gravis\n[12,89,90]. Avoidance of NMBAs is a common\nstrategy. If used, careful titration and monitoring of NMBAs is mandatory; quantitative monitoring should also be considered [91]. Patients exhibit a\nhigherthresholdtosuccinylcholine,butaresuscept-ible to a phase II block [92]. Sugammadex has been used successfully in myasthenia gravis and should be considered [29&]. Regional and local anesthesia have been used successfully. Postoperative venti-lation should be considered if patients exhibit signs of weakness. Weakness postoperatively may be\nmyasthenic crisis, residual anesthesia, residual NMBAs, or other perioperative medications that can exacerbate muscle weakness (i.e. gentamicin).\nCholingeric crisis is possible with anticholinesterase\nmedications [4]. ICU monitoring may be required.\nTable 3.

Clinical evaluation of muscle strength, such as head-lift or hand-grip, and respiratory parame-ters, such as tidal volume or vital capacity, are not sensitive for detecting neuromuscular weakness. The use of a peripheral nerve stim-ulator is therefore essential when any neuromuscular blocking drug is administered, yet a recent survey from Singapore [3] revealed that monitoring was used routinely by only 13% of anaesthetists, despite its widespread availability.\nThe objective, quantitative assessment of a train-of-four (TOF) response to ulnar nerve stimulation of the adductor pollicis muscle is the gold standard, and attaining a TOF ratio of 0.9 is generally accepted to indicate adequate recov-ery of neuromuscular function. Monitoring the TOF ratio is the only method to accurately deter-mine when it is appropriate to administer reversal agents and attempt tracheal extubation. Although monitoring the facial nerve is common, it is less accurate than the ulnar because the facial\nLtd., New Forest Enterprise Centre, Chapel Lane, Totton, UK). I per-sonally believe the extra cost is worth investing in, but most anaes-thetic departments still only possess qualitative monitors, even though the AAGBI recommends use of a quantitative peripheral nerve stimu-lator [5]. If a qualitative monitor is used, the ﬁrst twitch following a train-of-four stimulus appears at approximately 10% recovery, the second at 20%, the third at 30% and the fourth at 40%. The detec-tion of fade, either by tactile or visual methods, is not possible once the TOF ratio is 0.5 or more. This means that there is a window between 50% and 100% recovery of neuromuscular function when a reversal agent is often given.\nSong et al. [6] found that, fol-lowing cisatracurium administra-tion, if neostigmine was given when the fourth twitch in a TOF appeared (i.e. 40% recovery), it took between 9.0 and 15.5 min to attain a TOF ratio of 0.9. If neostigmine was given when there was no detec-tion of fade (i.e. 50% recovery or more) then this was reduced to between 4.0 min and 13.5 min. In addition, Choi et al. [7] demon-strated that, after administration of rocuronium, if the TOF ratio was\n0.5 and neostigmine 40 lg.kg 1 was\ngiven, then it only took a median of\n3.8 min to attain a TOF ratio of\n1.0. When there is moderate spon-taneous recovery of neuromuscular\nfunction (the presence of three or\nmore twitches in a TOF), then the\nissue of whether to give neostig-mine or sugammadex probably does\nnot arise; neostigmine can be given in an appropriate dose and a suit-able time allowed before its effects\nbecome apparent and tracheal extu-bation performed. A pragmatic\napproach to interpretation of the\nresponse to a TOF stimulus and\nadministration of either neostig-mine or sugammadex is shown in\nTable 1.\nIt is at deeper levels of neuro-muscular blockade where sugam-madex comes into its own.\nLaryngeal microsurgery is an exam-ple of a short procedure that\nrequires deep levels of anaesthesia\nand neuromuscular blockade. The\nlaryngeal muscles are relatively\nresistant to neuromuscular blockade\nand if sugammadex is available, because rapid reversal from a deep\nlevel of block is possible, anaes-thetists may have no hesitation in\nadministering a high dose of\nrocuronium.

Relatively small numbers of patients were included in the study and the anaesthetist was not blinded to patient grouping, but it does demonstrate that sugammadex is justiﬁed in at least some elective surgical situations.\nIt seems that the over-riding reason why sugammadex is limited in availability is cost. Sugammadex is still under patent and is expen-sive; £59.64 (Euro 69.40, $74.56) for a 200 mg vial and £149.10 (Euro 173.51, $186.40) for a 500 mg vial (source BNF, https://www.bnf.org/) compared with the neostigmine/ glycopyrrolate mixture which is\nSugammadex encapsulates rocuro-nium so, by ‘removing’ rocuronium molecules from the circulation, it might have a role in the treatment of rocuronium anaphylaxis. Spoerl et al. [11] described three patients with reactions to rocuronium that rapidly resolved following adminis-tration of sugammadex. Although such use of sugammadex might appear attractive, it is not licensed for this indication and the cases described by Spoerl et al. were in fact anaphylactoid, rather than truly anaphylactic. Indeed, Jones and Turkstra [12] urged caution when considering sugammadex in this context, because when it does encapsulate rocuronium, the por-tion of the rocuronium molecule that causes IgE cross-linkage (and hence anaphylaxis) may actually protrude and still make contact with circulating IgE. Also, because\n[14] reported 13 cases of presumed\nrocuronium-induced anaphylaxis in\nwhich sugammadex was adminis-tered, only eight (62%) of which\nwere later conﬁrmed to be type-1\nhypersensitivity reactions to rocuro-nium. Of the three patients in\nwhich the treating anaesthetist\nthought that sugammadex had been\nbeneﬁcial, one patient didn’t actu-ally have an allergy to rocuronium, one patient had no improvement in\ntheir blood pressure and the third\nstill required a large number of\nadrenaline boluses even after sug-ammadex administration. These\ndata suggest that sugammadex does\nnot in fact modify the clinical\ncourse of a suspected reaction to\nrocuronium. Not only that, but sug-ammadex itself may cause anaphy-laxis.

However,\nTable 2 A comparison between neostigmine and sugammadex. sugammadex offers some advan-\n \ntages over neostigmine. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade is quicker with sugammadex and the patient can, theoretically, be moved from the operating room to the recovery room more quickly, thus improving efﬁciency and reducing the costs of operating lists.

Previous studies of rocuronium and ve-\n	curonium (where patients did not receive sugamma-\n	dex for reversal of NMB) have indicated that the\n	duration of action of both NMBAs may be prolonged\n	in obese patients when they have been dosed accord-\n	ing to actual (real) body weight7–10; this prolonged\n	effect may be explained by a relative overdosing of\n	the NMBA in relation to the patient’s lean body\n	mass.47 As such, it is recommended that both rocuro-\n	nium and vecuronium doses are reduced in patients\n	with obesity, taking into account a lean body mass.48,49\n	The question could be raised as to whether the recom-\n	mended NMBA regimen would influence the current\n	results with respect to recovery. This is, however, very\n	unlikely, as the moment of the administration of su-\n	gammadex is based on the depth of the block and not\n	on the amount of NMBA administered. For example,\n	the presence or absence of NMBA maintenance doses\n	is not predictive of recovery after sugammadex. Also\n	illustrative is that the dose of 2 or 4 mg/kg of sugam-\n	madex is recommended completely independently of\n	the rocuronium or vecuronium regimen, but only de-\n	pends on the depth of the neuromuscular block: the\n	dose of 4 mg/kg is recommended when there is at\n	least one PTC, and 2 mg/kg when T2 has reappeared.\n	At present, there is insufficient evidence to recom-\n	mend any moderation of these sugammadex doses (eg,\n	dosing by ideal rather than actual body weight). The\n	efficacy of sugammadex in morbidly obese patients\nFIGURE 4.

The primary efficacy end point was the time from sugammadex administration to recovery of\nthe train-of-four ratio to 0.9; for succinylcholine, time from administration to recovery of the first twitch\n(T1) to 90% was assessed. From 167 patients enrolled, 150 received treatment. The all-subjects-treated\npopulation comprised 70 patients in the rocuronium–sugammadex group and 80 in the succinylcholine\ngroup. Geometric mean (95% confidence interval) time from the start of sugammadex administration to\nrecovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 was 1.8 (1.6–2.0) minutes. Geometric mean (95% confidence\ninterval) time from succinylcholine administration to recovery of T1 to 90% was 10.8 (10.1–11.5) minutes.\nHealth outcome variables were similar between the groups.

In this study, the combination of rocuronium for neuromuscular\nblockade (NMB) reversed by single-dose sugammadex was compared with succinylcholine followed by\nspontaneous recovery in outpatient surgery. This multicenter, randomized, safety assessor–blinded\nstudy enrolled adults undergoing a short elective outpatient surgical procedure requiring NMB and\ntracheal intubation. Patients were randomized to NMB with either rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg for tracheal\nintubation with incremental doses of rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg and subsequent reversal with sugamma-\ndex 4.0 mg/kg at 1–2 posttetanic counts or succinylcholine 1.0 mg/kg for intubation with spontaneous\nrecovery. The primary efficacy end point was the time from sugammadex administration to recovery of\nthe train-of-four ratio to 0.9; for succinylcholine, time from administration to recovery of the first twitch\n(T1) to 90% was assessed. From 167 patients enrolled, 150 received treatment. The all-subjects-treated\npopulation comprised 70 patients in the rocuronium–sugammadex group and 80 in the succinylcholine\ngroup. Geometric mean (95% confidence interval) time from the start of sugammadex administration to\nrecovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 was 1.8 (1.6–2.0) minutes. Geometric mean (95% confidence\ninterval) time from succinylcholine administration to recovery of T1 to 90% was 10.8 (10.1–11.5) minutes.\nHealth outcome variables were similar between the groups. Adverse events were reported in 87.1% and\n93.8% of patients for rocuronium–sugammadex and succinylcholine, respectively. In conclusion, rocuro-\nnium for intubation followed by sugammadex for reversal of NMB offers a viable treatment option in\noutpatient surgery without prolonging recovery duration or jeopardizing safety.\n \nKeywords: neuromuscular blockade, outpatient, rocuronium, succinylcholine, sugammadex\n \n1Department 2Department\nof Anesthesiology, Beaumont Health System, Royal Oak, MI; of Anesthesiology, David Geffen School of Medicine\n3Department\nat UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA;\n4Department 5Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain\nof Anesthesiology, UPMC Shadyside Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA;\nMedicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; 6Department of Anesthesiology, University of Utah\nHealth Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT; and 7Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, Whitehouse Station, NJ.\nSupported by Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck & Co.

Pa-\ntients were excluded if they met any of the following\nconditions: ischemic heart disease or a history of myo-\ncardial infarction, difficult intubation expected, neuro-\nmuscular disorder impairing NMB (eg, myasthenia\ngravis), use of a pneumatic tourniquet required during\nthe surgical procedure, had significant renal (creati-\nnine clearance ,30 mL/min) or hepatic dysfunction,\npersonal or family history of malignant hyperthermia,\nallergy to medications used during general anesthesia,\nhypersensitive to sugammadex or other cyclodextrins,\nor rocuronium bromide, contraindication to the study\ndrugs, expected to require postoperative admission to\nintensive care and/or hospital, or expected to receive\nan intraoperative intravenous administration of fluids\ncontaining potassium.\nNMB monitoring was performed using an appro-\npriately calibrated TOF-Watch SX device (Organon\nIreland Ltd, a subsidiary of Merck and Co, Swords,\nCo. Dublin, Ireland) affixed to an outstretched arm,\nand each study site was given training on the setup of\nthe TOF-Watch SX to reduce variability between sites\nand between individual patients at each site. Neuro-\nmuscular function was monitored continuously with\nacceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle\nwith the TOF-Watch SX device, starting after induc-\ntion of anesthesia, through to the end of anesthesia\nuntil the train-of-four (TOF) ratio was $\n0.9 (in the\nrocuronium–sugammadex group) or the first twitch\nof the TOF (T1)was$\n90% of baseline (in the succi-\nnylcholine group).\nTreatments\nPatients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive\neither rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg for tracheal intubation,\nwith rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg administered to main-\ntain NMB as required, followed by reversal of NMB\nwith a single 4.0 mg/kg dose of sugammadex deliv-\nered at a target depth of blockade of 1–2posttetanic\ncount (PTC) (ie, deep blockade), or succinylcholine\n1.0 mg/kg for tracheal intubation. Patients who\nreceived succinylcholine were allowed to recover\nspontaneously from NMB. The administration of su-\n–2 PTC was at a deep-\ngammadexatatargetdepthof1\ner level of blockade than is appropriate for\nadministration of anticholinesterases, which are only\neffective once moderate blockade (reappearance of\nthe second twitch of the TOF) has been attained.\nThe latter typically requires considerably longer to\nbe achieved than the first signs of recovery demon-\nstrated by posttetanic contractions as used in this\nstudy. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with\npropofol and inhalation agents.\nEvaluations\nThe primary efficacy end point was the time from the start of administration of sugammadex at deep block-ade to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9. Nondepolariz-ing NMBAs, such as rocuronium, produce\ncharacteristic TOF and tetanic fade, likely by block-ing presynaptic nicotinic receptors. Succinylcholine\ndoes not inhibit these presynaptic receptors at clini-cally relevant concentrations, and tetanic fade is not\nobserved in succinylcholine-induced NMB.9\nThere-fore, to evaluate neuromuscular recovery in the suc-cinylcholine group, a different monitoring procedure was implemented, and the time from the start of\nadministration of succinylcholine to T1 reaching 90% of baseline was assessed. In the rocuronium–su-gammadex group, other efficacy variables assessed\nwere the depth of blockade at the administration of\nsugammadex and the TOF ratio at tracheal extuba-tion. In the succinylcholine group, the T1 value at\ntracheal extubation was measured. Health outcome\nvariable measures were the time from patient admis-sion to the operating room until the patient was con-sidered ready for discharge from the operating room, and the time from admission to the PACU until the\npatient was considered ready for discharge from the\nPACU.\nEvidence of residual NMB or recurrence of NMB was assessed, indicated by a significant postoperative\ndecrease in the TOF ratio or based on clinical evidence as indicated by a significant change in respiratory rate or significant decrease in blood oxyhemoglobin satu-ration percent after the administration of sugammadex or succinylcholine.\nSafety assessments included AEs, heart rate, blood\npressure, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. The\nstudy incorporated a safety follow-up assessment at 7 days after surgery, either by telephone or visit, which\ncomprised recording any concomitant medication\nintake, assessment of AEs and SAEs, enquiring\nwhether the female subject or the spouse/partner of a male subject is pregnant or not, and completion of the end of trial form.\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) risk fac-tors10 were assessed for each patient before surgery, and the incidence of PONV was assessed based on AE reports of procedural nausea, nausea, procedural\nvomiting, and vomiting. All AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities\n(MedDRA version 12.1); a MedDRA lowest level term was chosen that best matched or approximated the\ninvestigator’s actual description, adhering to MedDRA\nrules and conventions.

A 95% CI\nfor geometric mean recovery time was calculated on\nthe log scale and transformed back to the original scale\n(time). As different end points for recovery from NMB\nwere used for the rocuronium–sugammadex and succi-\nnylcholine treatment groups in this study, no statistical\ncomparisons on time to recover from NMB were per-\nformed. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to com-\npare the other clinical outcome measures between\ntreatment groups where appropriate (with P , 0.05\nindicating significance).\nThe sample size for the study, which required\nenrollment of 70 patients per group, was based on\nthe primary safety objective of this trial (changes in\npotassium level from baseline at the 5-minute postdose\ntime point after administration of rocuronium, sugam-\nmadex, and succinylcholine, respectively); these re-\nsults have been reported previously.8\nWhite 52 (74) 67 (84)\nBlack or African 10 (14) 9 (11)\nAmerican\nAsian 4 (6) 1 (1)\nOther 4 (6) 3 (4)\nASA class, n (%)\nI 28 (40) 26 (33)\nII 41 (59) 46 (58)\nIII 1 (1) 8 (10)\nASA, American Society of Anesthesiologists; BMI, body mass index.\nPatient characteristics were generally comparable between the 2 treatment groups (Table 1).

This occurs despite Japanese hospitals often having a higher postoperative patient-to-nurse ratio than in the USA (i.e., it is not because the Japanese wards are functioning like PACUs).B Potentially, in Japan, more expensive devices and drugs are being used, facilitating fast recovery in the OR, while in the USA expensive PACU nurse labour is being used instead. We therefore speculate that there may be useful insights from the anesthesia techniques used in Japanese hospitals that recover patients exclusively in their ORs. Anesthesiologists working at hospitals with regular PACUs can use the insights when expected to recover the patient (i.e., the PACU is anticipated to be full).\nIn this historical cohort study, we compared the surgical recovery times between the University of Iowa hospital in Iowa City and the Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital near Tokyo. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that the times from end of surgery until the patients left for the surgical ward (i.e., ‘‘recovery times’’) would be much longer at the University of Iowa with a PACU compared with a Tokyo hospital that does not use a PACU.\nMethods\nThe Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the University of Iowa (201801768; 25 January 2018) and of Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital (20180219-1; 20 February 2018) approved this historical cohort study and considered it exempt from the requirement of obtaining written consent of patients.\nThe population studied was patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. We chose this population because it was the one category with many patients at both the investigators’ hospitals. No restriction was placed on whether the patient leaving the PACU (University of Iowa) or OR (Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital) was going to a hospital ward or to a phase II PACU location (see footnote A in the introduction). All successive patients were studied that met the following inclusion criteria: i) a laparoscopic gynecologic procedure was scheduled and performed for at least part of the\n \nA\nFor the current paper, we consider patients discharged to ward.\nGenerally, patients may be discharged from the phase I\npostanesthesia care unit (PACU) to the phase II PACU, a ward, or Sento et al. recently published their survey of hospitals in\nintensive care unit.\nJapan ﬁnding that only 16% have any phase I B\nAs reported by the Chief gynecologic nurse, each ward nurse at postanesthesia care unit (PACU) beds.1 The phase I Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital cares for an average of seven discharge-to-ward PACU is differentiated from the gynecologic patients, more than the ﬁve or six at the University of\nIowa.\n \n123\n \nRecovery times after anesthesia without PACU\n \nsurgical case (i.e., it could have been completed with laparotomy); ii) endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia was done; iii) actual hours from OR entrance until the last surgical dressing was placed on the patient was C two hours.\nPatients were selected in reverse sequence from 31 December 2017. Electronic chart review was performed for 16 successive patients (see the power analysis below). The requirement was placed on the protocol design that the study would be reevaluated if 16 such patients were not identiﬁed who had undergone surgery within six months (i.e., all patients studied had surgery between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2017). The dates were otherwise not recorded; only times were recorded, in accordance with the IRB protocol. This was because as the speciﬁc hospitals were being identiﬁed, the combination of procedure (inherently specifying sex) and date potentially could lead to identiﬁcation of the patients.3,4\nThe primary endpoint of this study was the ‘‘recovery time,’’ deﬁned as the time from end of surgery (i.e., ﬁnal wound covered)5 until the patient left for the hospital ward. If there were differences in recovery times, the anesthetic monitors and drugs used would be of interest and were therefore also recorded.\nStatistical methods\nThe primary method of statistical analysis was chosen a priori. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to estimate the probability (p00) that a randomly selected case at the University of Iowa had a longer time to recovery than did a randomly selected case at the Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital.\nThe secondary methods of analysis used generalized linear modeling, a log link function, and heteroscedastic-robust standard error. This analysis was performed while controlling for covariates, including the time from OR entrance to end of surgery. We expected this variable to be a signiﬁcant covariate that could cause bias because of its positive correlation among all types of procedures with the time from end of surgery to extubation.6\nThe following power analysis, as reported to the IRBs, was used to determine the sample size. Because of the multiple planned analyses, a type I two-sided error rate (alpha) of 0.01 was used: Z =Z = 2.58. In\nalpha/2 0.005\naddition, a 90% statistical power to detect a difference between hospitals was planned: Z =Z = 1.28.\nbeta 0.10\nAssuming equal sample sizes at each of the two hospitals, equation A3.2 in Divine et al. was applied to our problem7; accordingly, each group’s N = 2.48/(p00 - 0.5)2. From preliminary discussions about respective patients’ typical recovery times, we expected no overlap of recovery time between the US and Japanese hospitals, but also recognized\nthat there may be some overlap due to uncommon patient or operational conditions. We used p00 = 0.90 (i.e., at most\n10% overlap between groups) and thus obtained data on 16\nconsecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria at each\nhospital.\nResults\nAll 16 of the patients at the Shin-yurigaoka General\nHospital Tokyo went to the hospital ward directly from the OR. None of the 16 University of Iowa patients needed to\nwait in the PACU because a ward bed was unavailable (i.e., none of the measured recovery times was prolonged for\nsuch non-clinical reasons). All the data elements recorded\nabout each patient are listed in Table 1 along with the\nsummary measures.\nThe median [interquartile range] of recovery times was 112 [94-140] min at the University of Iowa and 22 [18-29] min at the Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital (Figure). Every\nstudied patient at the University of Iowa had a longer\nrecovery time than every such patient at Shin-yurigaoka\nGeneral Hospital (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, P \\ 0.001)\n(Figure). The ratio of the mean recovery times was 4.90\n(95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 4.05 to 5.91; P \\ 0.001), which remained comparable while controlling for the\nduration of surgery (5.33; 95% CI, 3.66 to 7.76; P \\\n0.001). Thus, the estimated mean recovery time at Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital was approximately 80% [i.e., 1- (1/4.90) = 79.6% and 1 - (1/5.33) = 81.2%] faster than that of the University of Iowa Hospital.\nCovariates that could not be studied were those that\ndiffered uniformly between the hospitals (Table 1). None of the patients at the University of Iowa had BISTM\n(Medtronic; Minneapolis, MN, USA) monitoring vs all the\npatients at Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital. In addition, all the patients at the University of Iowa had anesthetic\nmaintenance with a volatile agent, whereas all the patients at Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital received target-controlled infusions of propofol.

The recovery time was the time from ﬁnal wound covering until the patient left for the hospital ward. A potential independent variable that differed between hospitals was the time from operating room (OR) entrance to the ﬁnal dressing on the patient (Tables 1 and 2)\ngynecologic surgery were 80% faster than those of a US hospital that uses a PACU.\nOur results have economic implications. An anesthetic with BIS monitoring, propofol target-controlled infusion, remifentanil, acetaminophen, and sugammadex will have a greater device and drug cost than one with sevoﬂurane, hydromorphone, ketorolac, and neostigmine. Nevertheless, if an anesthesiologist is going to recover the patient 1:1 rather than a nurse caring for two patients in a PACU2 (with anesthesiologist backup), the labour costs per hour will be greater.8,9 Thus, the Japanese anesthesiologists substitute more expensive supplies/drug costs for less of their time (i.e., labour costs). The approach of using the BIS monitor and drugs with fast recovery time is sustained, in part, by the Japanese’ Diagnostic Procedure Combination hospital payment system that excludes anesthesia drugs, making them fee-for-service, paid by the patient’s insurance; thus, the hospital lacks incentive for lesser cost. This approach not to reduce the time spent in the PACU but to facilitate its bypass altogether matches the ﬁndings of the pharmacoeconomics of anesthetic drugs\nand techniques for outpatient surgery.10-12 For outpatient\nsurgery, this strategy lowers costs especially for facilities\nwith many patients per day, an eight-hour (vs a longer ten-hour) OR workday, and PACU nurses who either are\nsalaried or work full-time hourly and frequently have\novertime.13,14\nOur results are potentially useful at hospitals with\nregular PACU use when it is known before a case begins that the anesthesiologist likely will need to recover the\npatient in the OR (i.e., there will not be an available PACU bed and/or nurse). An example of such events is when there is damage to portions of the PACU (e.g., ﬂooding).15 Other\nsituations where this event might occur include when\npatients from another location (e.g., non-OR anesthetizing\nlocations) are being recovered temporarily in the surgical\nPACU (e.g., the other location’s PACU is temporarily\nclosed for renovations). Nevertheless, our ﬁndings that\ndifferent anesthetics can, in combination, result in recovery\ntimes that are only 20% as long were for gynecologic\nsurgery (Table 2). Knowing before the case begins that the\npatient has a substantial chance of needing recovery in the OR generally would depend on there being PACU stafﬁng\nshifts and start times chosen based on matching the\nexpected peak number of PACU patients by time of\n16-20 Even then, when there is a large variability among\nday.\ndays in the peak numbers of patients, predicting for the\n21 Nevertheless, this is not so\nindividual case is challenging.\nwhen a disruption is so large that there will inevitably be\n15 For example, if\ncases every day with recovery in the OR.\na 12-bed PACU only has eight beds available for surgical\npatients for a week (e.g., from renovation), and the other\npatients recover in the ORs, there will be negligible\nvariability in the peak number of patients in the PACU\n(i.e., it will be eight patients for most of the workday).\n22\nPlanning can be done in this circumstance.\nStudy limitations\nWe did not collect safety data and do not have the timing on when each patient met each of the multiple criteria for\n \nTable 2 Ratio of mean recovery times between University of Iowa and Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital in Tokyo\n \nVariable from Table 1 that differs signiﬁcantly but not completely	Mean (95% conﬁdence	P value for ratio	P value for\nbetween hospitals	interval)	of recovery times	covariate\n \n\n \nNone	4.90 (4.05 to 5.91)	\\ 0.001	\nTime from OR entrance to end of surgery	5.33 (3.66 to 7.76)	\\ 0.001	0.49\nHysterectomy	4.92 (4.11 to 5.90)	\\ 0.001	0.91\n \nRecovery time was measured as the period from end of surgery until the patient was ready to leave for the hospital ward. The non-signiﬁcant effect of surgical time had a narrow conﬁdence interval, with a 0.997 to 1.001-fold longer recovery time for each additional one minute of surgical time (i.e., 0.9995 to 1.0000 per hour). The generalized linear modeling also was performed using the sequence of the patients at each hospital as a continuous variable: 4.89 (4.10 to 5.83), P \\ 0.0001, and sequence P = 0.15.

Thenuwara et al.\n \ndischarge to the ward.C,23 However, the hospital in Tokyo does not have a PACU for any of its patients (i.e., it was not just unavailable for the study patients); only 16% of hospitals in Japan have any PACU beds.1 Thus, the relevant issue is not whether patients can safely undergo surgery and then go directly to a hospital ward with no greater numbers of nurses there than in North America. The question is how long patients routinely wait in the ORs recovering. The answer is vastly less time (20%) than that spent routinely in a phase I PACU. Nevertheless, while achieving this reduction in labour costs, the anesthetics were different and generally more expensive (i.e., substitution of drug/supply for labour costs). As referred to in the last paragraph of the results, from the data, we are unable to know which of the differences in drugs/supplies contribute to the briefer recovery times. We also cannot quantify whether recovery time is saved by not having a handoff of care or from heterogeneity in the use of discharge criteria.C\nWe limited the procedure category to laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, though this was unlikely to have inﬂuenced our conclusions. The principal covariates for recovery time after general anesthesia are not surgical procedure or patient sex, but availability of anesthesiologists, transport personnel, or ward beds, as well as patient pain.24,25\nWe did not have a way to collect patients’ initial postoperative pain scores, because the data were collected retrospectively. However, it is unlikely that differences in acute pain during the ﬁrst couple of hours after surgery account for the 4.9-fold differences in recovery times. However, our conclusions are limited to the fact that the recovery times differ markedly between hospitals; we do not have a way to know how the differences were achieved.\nThe application of our study was in the consideration of using different anesthetic techniques to reduce recovery times when the PACU is full. An alternative strategy may be to revise case sequencing to reduce the peak necessary number of PACU nurses and beds.26 When there are sufﬁcient nurses and beds to prevent delays from the OR into the PACU, case sequencing does not signiﬁcantly reduce the necessary PACU nursing hours.27 Nevertheless, that may not be so under the conditions in the present study. This would not change the results of our study about C\nAt the University of Iowa, the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge policy has three criteria in addition to those of the modiﬁed\n23\nAldrete score: normothermia, no indication of urinary retention or oliguria, and a minimum PACU time of 30 min. The latter had no inﬂuence on results as every patient had a PACU time [ 30 min (PACU minimum 36 min and recovery time minimum 58 min). At Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital, discharge to the ward was left to the judgment of the anesthesiologist; the electronic anesthesia chart has a\n23 built-in checklist, which is the same as the modiﬁed Aldrete score.\nrecovery times, but would reduce their usefulness, since if it were known ahead which patients likely will recovery in the ORs, the less expensive intervention would be case sequencing rather than using more expensive anesthetic drugs and supplies.\nConﬂicts of interest The Division of Management Consulting, Department of Anesthesia, University of Iowa, performs some of the calculations described in this article.

The investigation is retro-\nspective, and the rate of PONV was low. The conclusions must therefore be interpreted\ncautiously.\n \nPost-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a As a result, PONV lengthens hospital stays and common complication that causes discomfort, increases medical cost.2 The incidence of PONV pain, and surgical site instability, including has been reported to be 30% in general patients, wound dehiscence and bleeding.1 Furthermore, and as high as 80% in high-risk patients.3,4 PONV increases the risk of aspiration, the inci- Opioid-based, intravenous, patient-controlled dence of electrolyte imbalance, and dehydration. analgesia (IV-PCA) aggravates PONV; however,\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45	\nª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

LEE ET AL.\n \nsuch treatment is necessary for patients who have undergone surgery.5\nThere are several types of receptor for emetogenic neurotransmitters: dopamine (D )\n2 receptors, histaminic (H ) receptors, 5-hydroxy-\n1\ntryptamine (serotonin) receptors, and mus-\n3\ncarinic-cholinergic receptors.6 On this theoretical basis, cholinesterase inhibitors (neostigmine in particular), which are used to reverse non-depo-larizing neuromuscular blocking agents, have been associated with increased PONV.7–10\nPyridostigmine, which is also classiﬁed as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is structurally similar to neostigmine. No association has yet been revealed between pyridostigmine and PONV. However, pyridostigmine overdose does cause cholinergic symptoms, including nausea and\n11;\nvomiting for this reason, it is theoretically possible that pyridostigmine causes PONV.\nSugammadex is a new gamma-cyclodextrin drug that binds to aminosteroidal non-depolar-izing neuromuscular blocking agents.12 It is a fast-onset drug that resolves residual paralysis without the muscarinic side effects that occur with traditional anticholinergic-cholinesterase inhibitor mixtures13 Furthermore, sugammadex has been associated with a lower rate of PONV than neostigmine.14,15\nNonetheless, no studies have been carried out comparing the rates of PONV between sugammadex and pyridostig-mine.\nFor this reason, we designed a retrospective study to compare the incidence and severity of PONV between sugammadex and pyridostig-mine–glycopyrrolate mixture.\nMethods\nStudy design\nAfter obtaining approval of Institutional Review Board of Chung-Ang University Hospital [IRB No. C2015250(1708)], we reviewed the elec-tronic medical records of 7179 adults who had undergone general anesthesia at Chung-Ang University Hospital between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. All the patients had been treated using fentanyl-based IV-PCA. We anonymized and de-identiﬁed all information prior to analysis, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The reversal\nagents were injected immediately after the end of the surgery; patients were excluded from the study if no reversal agents were used. We classi-ﬁed patients into two groups on the basis of the reversal agent used: pyridostigmine–glycopyrro-late mixture (Group R) and sugammadex (Group S). The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemi-ology) checklist was used to construct this manuscript.16\nPCA protocol\nIn our institution, we used the existing stan-dardized IV-PCA protocol of the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine: standard-ized to continuous infusion of 1 ml/h, as well as a bolus of 1 ml with a 15-min lockout interval. The 100-ml IV-PCA solution contained fentanyl, ketorolac or nefopam, and ramosetron or palo-nosetron. The correct dosage of fentanyl, ketoro-lac, or nefopam was established according to the Department of Surgery concerned, and the expected intensity of pain (mild, moderate, or severe) after each type of surgery.\nData collection\nUsing the data recorded by a nurse dedicated to the management of patients with IV-PCA, we noted demographic and perioperative factors that are related to PONV. The nurse only under-took tasks related to IV-PCA, and she made the rounds at least once a day to investigate issues related to IV-PCA, including PONV. She had 5 years’ clinical experience, and she collected data after being trained in the standardized pro-tocols of pain and PONV investigation. Further-more, we excluded the data collected during the ﬁrst 2 years of her PCA rounds (2008–2009). Speciﬁcally, we collected data on age, gender, height, weight, history of smoking, PONV, type of anesthetic agents used (propofol, desﬂurane, or sevoﬂurane), use of N O, remifentanil, use of\n2\nanticholinergics (glycopyrrolate) as premedica-tion, use of nefopam, ketorolac, ramosetron, or palonosetron in IV-PCA, dosage of fentanyl in IV-PCA, laparoscopic surgery, and operation duration. Furthermore, the post-operative vari-ables collected were severity of nausea, fre-quency of vomiting, use of rescue antiemetics,\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45 40 ª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

These variables were measured on post-operative days 0; CR was deﬁned as no nausea, no vomiting, and no requirement for antiemetics during post-opera-tive days 0.\nSeverity of nausea was recorded using a numeric rating scale (0 = no nausea, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = worst imaginable). Statistics\nWe matched patients from Group R at a 4 to 1 ratio with those from Group S using a propen-sity score matching method. Because this was a retrospective cohort study, not a randomized clinical trial, potential confounding factors were caused by biased covariates and non-randomiza-tion; thus, comparability between Groups R and S was problematic.17,18 For this reason, we con-ducted propensity score matching – to decrease the potential confounding. We calculated the propensity score using logistic regression analy-sis; the following covariates were used: age, gender, height, weight, history of smoking, PONV, type of anesthetic agents used (propofol, desﬂurane, or sevoﬂurane), use of N Oor\n2\nremifentanil, use of anticholinergics (glycopy-rrolate) as premedication, use of nefopam, ketorolac, ramosetron, or palonosetron in IV-PCA, dosage of fentanyl in IV-PCA, laparo-scopic surgery, and operation duration.19 After the propensity scores were calculated, we used propensity score similarities to select the near-est-available match between the groups; the caliper radius was set at 0.001. To evaluate the balance between the matched groups, we tested the standardized difference for each of the covariates mentioned above. Speciﬁcally, the standardized difference is the difference in means between the groups – in units of stan-dard deviation. Comparability between the groups is usually considered to be good when the standardized difference is less than 20%.20\nAfter matching, we collected and compared the dosage of reversal agents, as well as the Department of Surgery concerned, usage of neu-romuscular monitoring and intraoperative opi-oids in each of the matched groups.\nFor continuous variables, the data distribution was ﬁrst evaluated for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data\nwere then compared using parametric methods; non-normally distributed data were analyzed using non-parametric methods.\nPaired t-test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare continuous variables, and McNemar test was used to compare descriptive variables.\nContinuous variables were expressed as mean   SD, and descriptive variables were expressed as absolute number (%). The 95% conﬁdence intervals (C.I.) for difference were also calculated.\nP-values < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software suite (version 23; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\nResults\nWe reviewed 7179 adult patients who had undergone general anesthesia and treated using fentanyl-based IV-PCA at Chung-Ang Univer-sity Hospital between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. Group R contained 7059 patients, while Group S contained 120 patients.\nGroup R vs. Group S in the matched set The demographic and clinical characteristics of the matched cohort are shown in Table 1. After propensity score matching, there were 408 patients in Group R and 115 in Group S. All 20 confounding variables had an acceptable stan-dardized difference (i.e., < 20%), indicating that the matching procedure was efﬁcient in creating a balance between the groups (Table 1). The fol-lowing variables showed signiﬁcant differences between Group R and Group S: the nausea numeric rating scale score was lower in Group S than in Group R [0.33   0.74 vs. 0.17   0.42, respectively; difference (95% C.I.) = 0.17 (0.03– 0.31), P = 0.002]; the frequency of vomiting was lower in Group S than in Group R [0.10   0.32 vs. 0.04   0.21, respectively; difference (95% C.I.) = 0.06 (0.01–0.11), P = 0.036]; use of rescue antiemetics was lower in Group S than in Group R [160 (39.2%) vs. 33 (28.7%), respec-tively; difference (95% C.I.) = 0.11 (0.01–0.21), P = 0.039]; CR was higher in Group S than in Group R [221 (54.2%) vs. 77 (67%),\n \n\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45	\nª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

There was no signiﬁcant difference between the groups in terms of the Department of Surgery concerned, usage of neuromuscular monitoring and intraoperative opioids (P = 0.760, P = 0.577, P = 0.964, respectively; Table 3).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, the frequency of post-opera-tive vomiting and the severity of post-operative nausea were lower when the neuromuscular block was reversed using sugammadex than when it was reversed using the pyridostigmine– glycopyrrolate mixture. Furthermore, the frequency of CR was higher when sugammadex was used.\nThese ﬁndings corroborate those of previous studies. For instance, in a retrospective study by Ledowski et al., reversal of neuromuscular blockade using sugammadex caused less PONV than reversal using neostigmine.15 Similarly, in a randomized clinical trial by Koyuncu et al., reversal using sugammadex resulted in lower PONV than reversal using neostigmine–atropine mixture.14\nOn the other hand, our results differ from those of Abad-Gurumeta et al. In a meta-analy-sis, they reported that the frequency of PONV does not differ signiﬁcantly between neostig-\n21\nmine and sugammadex. However, they also found that their analysis had insufﬁcient power due to limited data.\nTraditional strategies for reversal of neuromus-cular blockade use a mixture of anticholinergics and cholinesterase inhibitors. Although they con-veniently reverse neuromuscular blockade, they are associated with cholinergic side effects such\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45 42 ª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Indeed, acetylcholine receptors are known for being distributed in the emetogenic center of brain, as well as in the gas-trointestinal tract.8 Therefore, cholinesterase inhibitors could in theory decrease esophageal sphincter pressure, and increase the secretion of stomach ﬂuid and intestinal movement. These mechanisms may be responsible for cholinester-ase inhibitor-associated PONV, and may explain the lower PONV associated with sugammadex in\nthe present study. In particular, relative over-doses of pyridostigmine compared to anticholin-ergics may also cause PONV. However, in the present study, the administered doses of glycopy-rrolate and pyridostigmine were 0.54   0.10 mg and 14.77   2.16 mg, respectively. Indeed, these are the usual doses and ratios of these reversal agents.22 Thus, we assumed that pyridostigmine overdose was not the cause of PONV in the pre-sent study.\nSeveral clinical studies and reviews have been conducted regarding the relationship between PONV and neostigmine; these have yielded uncertain and conﬂicting conclusions. For instance, in a meta-analysis by Cheng et al., neostigmine did not signiﬁcantly increase PONV during the post-operative period; the authors suggested that the data were insufﬁcient to con-\n23 Speciﬁ-clude that neostigmine causes PONV.\ncally, they stated that the lack of a signiﬁcant result was due to the limited numbers of control groups and patients. In any case, the Cheng study did not consider sugammadex for compar-ison. This limitation could be resolved in a future study that involving a control group in which sugammadex was used. With such a study, the association between PONV and choli-nesterase inhibitors would also be clearer.\nFurthermore, to our knowledge, the present arti-cle is the ﬁrst to report a relationship between pyri-dostigmine and PONV. There have been no randomized controlled trials comparing pyridostig-mine and sugammadex in terms of their effect on PONV; such trials may therefore be needed.\nReducing controllable risk factors can signiﬁ-cantly decrease the rate of PONV. However, most clinicians do not consider the risk of PONV when selecting reversal agents, because the conclusions of previous studies have been uncertain, and\n \n\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45	\nª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Nevertheless, we believe that we can reduce both residual paralysis and PONV with a single drug: sugammadex. However, owing to the high cost of sugammadex, a pharmacoeconomic analysis should also be conducted.\nRegarding post-operative pain after sugam-madex use, there may be some relationship between PONV and post-operative pain. In a randomized trial by Castro et al. involving patients who had undergone laparoscopic baria-tric surgery, reversal using sugammadex resulted in lower PONV and pain than reversal using neostigmine, and these results are similar to the present study.24 The authors conjectured that, because patients had lower levels of post-operative pain, they tended to use less opioid analgesics, and this in turn reduced the inci-dence of PONV. For this reason, it will be nec-essary to exclude the possibility that pain affects PONV before a conclusion can be drawn in this regard. For solving this point, we used the existing standardized IV-PCA protocol of our institution in the present study. As mentioned above, the IV-PCA drug dose of this protocol is determined according to the Department of Sur-gery and expected intensity of pain (mild, mod-erate, and severe) after each type of surgery. For this reason, the dose of fentanyl in the IV-PCA was matched between Groups R and S, and it is therefore likely that the surgical pain of each surgery was also matched. Furthermore, there were no differences between the groups with regard to the Department of Surgery.\nBecause this was a retrospective study, we tried to minimize bias and improve the quality of the study in various ways. Unlike a simple retro-spective chart review, the database was prospec-tively designed and recorded by one clinically experienced investigator who has long been responsible for IV-PCA; this minimized inter-observer variation, as well as subjectivity and other biases. Moreover, we excluded the early data, as it was likely to contain errors, incom-pleteness, and bias. Objective variables, such as the administration of rescue antiemetics, and CR, were collected to minimize the inﬂuence of sub-jective variables like PONV (Table 2). In addi-tion, we conducted propensity score matching to decrease the effects of known confounding fac-tors, and we compared both groups in terms of\nthe Department of Surgery, usage of neuromus-cular monitoring and intraoperative opioids to conﬁrm there were no signiﬁcant differences between the groups in this regard.\nThere were some limitations of this study. Firstly, because this was a retrospective study that collected data over a long period, some data were missing or incomplete. If these data had been investigated, the results would have been more conclusive. Secondly, the population of the pre-sent study was a very heterogeneous, and the risk of PONV was lower. For this reason, further inves-tigation is needed targeting the population with higher risk of PONV. Thirdly, because this was not a randomized controlled study, we cannot rule out confounding. Furthermore, although we used propensity score matching for known confounders, unknown risk factors may have inﬂuenced the results. Therefore, it may be necessary in future to carry out a randomized controlled trial comparing sugammadex and pyridostigmine–glycopyrrolate mixture. Fourthly, because this was a single-center study in Korea, our results may not be directly applicable to other countries and races. Finally, we did not divide the post-operative variables in this study into immediate PONV, early PONV, and late PONV; thus, we cannot determine whether the degree of PONV changed as time passed.\nIn conclusion, the severity and incidence of PONV in patients receiving opioid-based IV-PCA were lower in the sugammadex group than in the pyridostigmine–glycopyrrolate mixture group. However, these ﬁndings do not conﬁrm causality, because this was retrospective cohort study. Thus, further prospective randomized controlled studies should be needed to conﬁrm this conclusion.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank S-H Han for her effort to collect data.\nReferences\n1.

Deep muscle relaxation reduces the surgical field pres-sure and makes the operation easier [1-3]. Until recently, cho-linesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine and neostigmine, have been administered to reverse muscle relaxants. These drugs increase the concentration of acetylcholine in the neuromuscu-lar junction and compete with non-depolarized muscle relax-ants at the receptor to reverse muscle relaxation [4]. However, cholinesterase inhibitors may still cause acute respiratory events, such as hypoxemia, airway obstruction, and postoperative \n \nCC This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/\nlicenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n \nCopyright ⓒ the Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2017	Online access in http://ekja.org\n \nKOREAN J ANEStHESIOL	Cho et al.\n \n\n \npulmonary complications, because they are not direct muscle relaxation antagonists [5-8]. Additionally, unpleasant symptoms, such as muscle weakness, longer post-anesthesia care unit stays, and delayed tracheal extubations may occur [9].\nSugammadex is the first selective relaxant binding agent, which is a synthetically modified gamma-cyclodextrin. Suga-mmadex reverses muscle relaxation quickly and safely from deep anesthesia levels by binding directly with steroidal neuro-muscular blocking agents, such as rocuronium or vecuronium without residual muscle relaxation [8,10,11]. Therefore, the use of sugammadex for neuromuscular blockade reversal can be expected to enable deep breathing and help restore pulmonary function as soon as possible. We hypothesized that these effects would result in decreased postoperative pulmonary complica-tions that have been reviewed in lobectomy studies such as pneumonia, atelectasis, and prolonged air leak [12-15].\nThis study sought to retrospectively evaluate the use of su-gammadex in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy. Materials and Methods\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the patients who were transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) after general anesthesia in the central operating suite from January 1, 2013 to November 30, 2014 (IRB No. 14-231).\nThis study was conducted following the guidelines of the STROBE statement [16]. The data were retrospectively obtained from medical record review of patients. The inclusion criteria were the following: 1) patients older than 20 years; 2) American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classifications I, II, and III; and 3) patients operated on via video-assisted tho-racoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Cases converted to open surgery or bilateral surgery were excluded.\nIn our hospital, neuromuscular function is monitored at the adductor pollicis muscle using the train of four (TOF) during VATS lobectomy. According to protocol for reversal of muscle relaxant, a single bolus dose of traditional reversal (pyridostig-mine 20 mg with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg or atropine 0.5 mg) or sugammadex 2 mg/kg is administered if spontaneous recovery has reached the reappearance of a second twitch in response to TOF stimulation. Neuromuscular monitoring continues until the end of anesthesia and at least until recovering a TOF ratio of 0.9, which is considered sufficient for safe extubation. Postop-erative care including chest tube use, duration of ventilator use, ICU stay and postoperative hospital stay are routinely imple-mented according to VATS lobectomy protocol at the Depart-ment of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. All patients re-ceived 0.9 mg/kg of rocuronium for induction, and maintenance vecuronium was administered. Patient controlled analgesia for postoperative pain control consisted of fentanyl 5 μg/kg/h for all \npatients.\nFifty patients who underwent VATS lobectomy were divided into two groups: the sugammadex group (group S, n = 19) was administered sugammadex 2 mg/kg, while the pyridostigmine group (group P, n = 28) received a single bolus dose of tradi-tional reversal (pyridostigmine 20 mg with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg or atropine 0.5 mg). Because sugammadex has only been used since January 2014 at our institution, group P and group S represent data collected before and after this time point, respec-tively.\nAnthropometric information, comorbidities, preoperative arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA), pulmonary function tests (PFTs), chest X-ray, and chest computed tomography findings were confirmed by examining the medical records. Tumor stages, locations of the lobectomy sites, anesthesia and opera-tion times, the administration of sugammadex, intraoperative ABGA, and time to extubation after termination of anesthesia were investigated using the anesthesia and operative records. Tumor type and the surgical margin of the incision site were confirmed. Intraoperative hypoxia was defined as a saturation less than 95% oximetry or arterial oxygen partial pressure less than 80 mmHg during surgery. The primary endpoint measure was the overall incidence of postoperative pulmonary complica-tions including prolonged air leak, pneumonia, and atelectasis as confirmed from progress and discharge records. Postopera-tive pulmonary complications was observed during the entire period from the operation to the day of discharge. A prolonged air leak was defined as an air leak present on postoperative day 4. Atelectasis and pneumonia were diagnosed based on radiologic readings of postoperative chest X-ray. The secondary endpoint measures were the length of postoperative hospital stay and du-ration of chest tube insertion. These factors were also confirmed by examining progress records.\nAll measured values were statistically analyzed using SPSS ver. 21.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For continu-ous variables, the data distribution was firstly evaluated for nor-mality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. As age, body mass index, operation and anesthetic durations passed the normality test, they were analyzed using the t-test. Since the length of ven-tilation, ICU stay, chest tube duration, and postoperative hospi-tal stay did not pass the normality test, they were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test. ASA physical status, comorbidities and specific complications were analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests. In addition, univariate and subsequent multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify demographic and clinical variables associated with complications. Variables with P < 0.2 in the univariate logistic regression analysis were entered into the multivariate logistic re-gression analysis using backward selection. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. \n \n\n \nOnline access in http://ekja.org	421\n \nUse of sugammadex with VATS lobectomy	VOL. 70, NO. 4, AuguSt 2017\n \nResults P = 0.049); however, no statistically significant differences in any \nof the specific complications were observed between the two \nA total of 54 patients were included.

These studies have shown that the use of sugammadex has reduced postop-erative residual curarization (PORC) in the PACU [6,10]. This study showed that the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was lower and the duration of postoperative hos-pital stay was shorter in the patients undergoing lobectomy with suggamadex treatment.\nIn this study, respiratory complications including prolonged air leak, pneumonia, and atelectasis occurring after lobectomy were evaluated, and we thought that the use of sugammadex as a neuromuscular blockade reversal reduced overall pulmo-nary complications. Although sugammadex has been shown to reduce the total number of postoperative complications, there were no significant differences in specific pulmonary complica-tions. This is thought to be due to the limitation of the number of subjects. We only had a sample size of 50 patients. In studies comparing thoracoscopic surgery and thoracotomy, respiratory and cardiovascular complications, especially atrial fibrillation, were common [12-15], but cardiovascular problems were rarely observed in this study. However, the decrease in complication rate is similar to the result of other studies in which the fre-quency of critical respiratory events is decreased due to the use \nof sugammadex. Martinez-Ubieto et al. [6] examined whether the TOF level, type of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) and reversal agents used, and respiratory events in the PACU were associated with an increased incidence of pneumonia and atelectasis during hospital admission. By studying critical re-spiratory event percentages for each of the groups identified by type of NMBAs and reversal agents used, significant differences were observed between the rocuronium-sugammadex group (1.1%) compared to the rocuronium group (9.7%) and the cisa-tracurium-neostigmine group (8.7%).\nThe decrease in the duration of chest tube insertion and postoperative hospital stay in this study may also be the result of reduced postoperative pulmonary complication. Sugammadex induces rapid reversal, quick restoration of normal skeletal mus-cle function and achivement of deep breaths without residual muscle relaxation, which reduces the incidence of atelectasis, help to restore pulmonary function [8,10,11], and allows the chest tube to be removed as soon as possible. These factors may reduce the length of postoperative hospital stay.\nThe extra few minutes of reversal advantage could translate into real clinical benefits. Studies have been reported that re-sidual muscle relaxation progresses to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis during hospital stays. Marti-nez-Ubieto et al. [6] demonstrated that the presence of PORC in the PACU shows a significant association with the development of postoperative critical respiratory events such as pneumonia, atelectasis and that the use of sugammadex significantly reduces the incidence of PORC in the PACU. Grosse-Sundrup et al. [17] demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary \n \n\n \nOnline access in http://ekja.org	423\n \nUse of sugammadex with VATS lobectomy	VOL. 70, NO. 4, AuguSt 2017\n \n\n \ncomplications within seven postoperative days associated with the use of intermediate acting NMBAs. The authors inferred that the lingering effects of NMBAs are likely to have caused respiratory compromise in vulnerable patients. Another study reported that pulmonary outcomes deteriorated significantly in patients over 60 years of age with ASA physical status of 3 or 4 who were administered neostigmine or no reversal agent, but al-most no detrimental effects were reported in the group that was administered sugammadex [18].\nIn this study, we could not confirm an association between sugammadex use and cardiovascular complications. However, a study comparing the use of sugammadex versus neostigmine in a patient with obstructive sleep apnea [7], reported that circulation-related complications including bradycardia, tachy-cardia, hypotension, hypertension, and arrythmia were signifi-cantly reduced in the group using sugammadex compared to the group using neostigmine. (5.4% vs. 37.8%). They assumed that circulation-related complications in patients who were given neostigmine might be associated with the later improvement in neuromuscular conduction. Therefore, in this study, the use of sugammadex can be considered to reduce cardiovascular com-plications that commonly occur in patients undergoing lobec-tomy. The action mechanism of sugammadex is dependent on the chemical encapsulation of the neuromuscular blocking agent molecule and does not involve a direct interaction with the cholinergic system. Comparatively, the administration of pyr-idostigmine leads to increased airway resistance and bradycar-dia and the administration of atropine or glycopyrrolate leads to tachycardia. Therefore, sugammadex may decrease pneumonia-causing secretions and cardiovascular disease [19,20].\nThis study examined the effect of the use of sugammadex in the postoperative period, but not in the PACU. However, data on residual curarization recorded after ICU transfer could not be confirmed. Only, there were no reintubations in the ICU, sug-gesting that there were no serious complications due to residual curarization. The most common complication after tracheal extubation is coughing. Though coughing is usually not a com-plication in itself, coughing may increase arterial pressure, heart rate and intraocular or intracranial pressure, and ineffective or persistent coughing might be associated with complications such as laryngospasm [21]. Therefore, it is a limitation of this study that we could not confirm minor respiratory events due to residual curarization such as coughing.\nWe began using the sugammadex in our hospital during the second half of 2013, and this measure has been used mainly with patients who are being transported to the ICU since 2014 for the prevention of hypoventilation during the transfer to the ICU. Thus, this study was divided into two groups based on January 2014. For this reason, this study may have limitations as a retrospective study because there is a possibility that a vari-able is dependent on the progress of time. However, anesthesia management and perioperative management were performed according to the Department of Anesthesiology and the Depart-ment of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery protocols. Since the operations were performed by a specialist who has per-formed the operation since the late 1990s, the difference in the operator’s skill level is expected to be minimal. In addition, there was no change in the drug during the study period, and there was no case of delayed recovery due to infection at the surgical site. Therefore, this study seems to have no difference in patient care in accordance with the protocol between the two groups, despite its retrospective nature.\nIn conclusion, the use of sugammadex, compared with pyr-idostigmine, showed a significant reduction in the overall inci-dence of postoperative pulmonary complications and decreased the duration of chest tube use and postoperative hospital stay in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy, suggesting that sugam-madex might be helpful in improving clinical outcomes in such patients. However, large-scale of prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the beneficial effects of sugammadex.\nAcknowledgments \nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Sinyoung Kang, Associ-ate Professor of the Department of Anesthesia in University of Iowa for her comments on this manuscript.\nThis study was supported by Dong-A University research fund.\nORCID\nSeung Cheol Lee, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8669-5517   Sang Yoong Park, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7495-8025\nSo Ron Choi, https://orcid.org/ 0000-0002-4173-8939\n \nReferences\n \n1.

Until recently, intraoperative deep neuromuscular block was eschewed because of con-cerns about recovery at the end of surgery. Indeed, the reported incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade may reach 50 % even after the use of interme-diate-acting muscle relaxants and reversal with\n \n123\n \nWorld J Surg (2016) 40:2898–2903	2899\n \n\n \nanticholinesterase [1, 2]. With the introduction of sugam-madex, a newer reversal agent, immediate reversal of even deep neuromuscular blockade has become possible without residual blockade [3]. Thus, there is now no reason to avoid deep neuromuscular blockade if sugammadex is available as a reversal agent. However, the beneﬁts of maintaining deep neuromuscular blockade during surgery have not been thoroughly evaluated.\nSince the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), the beneﬁcial effects of low-pressure versus stan-dard-pressure pneumoperitoneum on patient outcomes have been shown in many studies [4–6]. However, most surgeons prefer standard-pressure to low-pressure pneu-moperitoneum because of the technical difﬁculty of the latter. Indeed, studies have shown that the surgeon’s comfort is signiﬁcantly lower and the number of patients requiring increased pressure for inadequate visual ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly higher with low-pressure than with standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum [5, 7].\nIn this prospective, randomized, controlled study, we evaluated the effect of intraoperative deep neuromuscular blockade on surgical conditions during LC under low-pressure pneumoperitoneum. The primary outcome vari-able was the rate of increasing intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) by the surgeon when they decided that the surgical conditions were inadequate for the operation. The sec-ondary outcome variables were the surgeon’s surgical condition score, operation time, and postoperative out-comes such as pain, shoulder tip pain, dry mouth, and nausea and vomiting.\nMaterials and methods\nThisstudywasapprovedbytheInstitutionalReviewBoardof Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do,RepublicofKorea, ProtocolNo:B-1307/212-001,27-08-2013),registeredatcris.nih.go.kr(KCT0001090), and carried out from September 2013 to April 2014 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Written informed consentwasobtainedfromallpatients.Patients18–69 yearsof agewithanASAclassiﬁcationofIorIIwhowerescheduledto undergoelectiveLCwereincluded.Theexclusioncriteriawere a history of neuromuscular, renal, or hepatic disease, a body massindexof 18.5or C30.0 kg/m2,ahistoryofabdominal\n\\\nsurgery,treatmentwithdrugsknowntointerferewithneuro-muscularfunction,andacutecholecystitis.\nPatients were randomized to either the moderate or deep neuromuscular blockade groups using a computer—gen-erated randomization code (Random Allocation Software, version 2.0) the results of which were sealed in an opaque envelope.Randomization was conducted by a person who was not involved in the study, and an independent observer\nwho was blind to the group assignment checked the\nintraoperative and postoperative data. Premedication with\nintravenous midazolam at 0.02 mg/kg was performed in the reception area. In the operating room, routine moni-toring was performed, including electrocardiography, noninvasive arterial pressure measurements, and pulse\noximetry. Additionally, acceleromyography (TOF-Watch-SX; MSD BV, Oss, The Netherlands) was applied to\nmonitor the response of the adductor pollicis muscle.\nNeuromuscular management and monitoring were per-formed according to the Good Clinical Research Practice\nguidelines [8]. After the induction of anesthesia with\npropofol and remifentanil using target-controlled infusers and before rocuronium administration, the TOF-Watch-SX was calibrated and stabilized; a 50-Hz tetanic stimulation was applied for 5 s, the TOF-Watch-SX was calibrated, and a series of train-of-four (TOF) measurements were\ndocumented for 2 min until a stable baseline was\n[\nobtained ( 5 % variation in the TOF ratios). Next, intra-\n\\\nvenous rocuronium at 0.6 mg/kg was administered, and\ntracheal intubation was performed after conﬁrmation of\nrelaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with target-con-trolled infusion of propofol and remifentanil while moni-toring the bispectral index (A-2000 BISTM monitor; Aspect\nMedical Systems, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). A bolus dose of\nintravenous rocuronium (5–10 mg) was used to maintain\nmoderate (TOF count of 1 or 2) or deep (posttetanic count\n[PTC] of 1 or 2) neuromuscular blockade. At the beginning of the operation, the IAP was set at 8 mmHg by controlling the limit of the CO insufﬂator. The surgeons were allowed\n2\nto change the IAP to 12 mmHg if they decided that the\nsurgical conditions were inadequate for the operation. The rate of increasing the IAP was evaluated in this study. Any\nmovement during the operation as reported by the surgeon or anaesthesiologist was recorded. At the end of the oper-ation, the surgeon rated the surgical condition on a 4-point\nscale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = acceptable, 4 = poor). Patients in the moderate group were reversed\nwith neostigmine at 50 lg/kg and glycopyrrolate at 10 lg/ kg at a TOF count of 1 or 2, and patients in the deep group\nwere reversed with intravenous sugammadex at 4 mg/kg at\nPTC of 1 or 2. The time from administration of the reversal\nagents to a TOF ratio of 0.9 was recorded. Postoperative\npain and shoulder tip pain were evaluated at 30 min and 24 h postoperatively using a 10-point numerical rating\nscale. Fentanyl was injected intravenously as needed to\ncontrol postoperative pain in the postanesthesia care unit, and the doses administered were recorded. Postoperative\nnausea and/or vomiting, and dry mouth, were also evalu-ated at the same time points. The patient, the surgeon who\nrated the surgical conditions, and the staff member who\nchecked the postoperative outcome variables were blinded to the patient group.\n \n123\n \n2900		World J Surg (2016) 40:2898–2903\nFig. 1	Consort diagram	\n \nStatistical analysis times, and operation times were performed with Student’s\nt test.

This ﬁnding has important clinical\nsigniﬁcance today, when increasingly more complicated\nmajor operations are performed under laparoscopic\nsurgery.\nDifferent muscles do not respond uniformly to neuro-\nmuscular blocking agents. The abdominal muscles and\ndiaphragm recover more rapidly from neuromuscular\nblockade than the adductor pollicis muscle, which is the\nmain site monitored during neuromuscular blockade\n[16, 17].

One possible Other reasons could be the differences in the type and explanation for this ﬁnding is that deep neuromuscular\n \n123\n \nWorld J Surg (2016) 40:2898–2903	2903\n \n\n \nblockade provided more favorable conditions for operative procedures and induced less tissue injury and hence less postoperative pain and shoulder tip pain. Additionally, the low pressure itself compared with standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum could be a factor involved in reducing postoperative pain and shoulder tip pain [4, 6]. The inci-dence of dry mouth at 24 h postoperatively was also lower in the deep group. This might be related to the absence of neostigmine, which has a cholinergic action, in the deep group. Based on these results, we showed that maintaining intraoperative deep neuromuscular blockade and perform-ing reversal with sugammadex can affect not only the intraoperative surgical conditions but also the postopera-tive recovery proﬁles.\nOne limitation of our study is that we excluded patients with acute cholecystitis; our results are conﬁned to patients without acute inﬂammation. We excluded these patients because we assumed that the procedure would be more complicated and less predictable in these patients. The second limitation is that our study was not sufﬁciently powered to detect differences for the secondary outcome variables such as operation time, postoperative pain, shoulder tip pain, dry mouth, and nausea and vomiting. Indeed, we found no difference in the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in our patients. However, controversy exists regarding postoperative nausea and vomiting with neostigmine use, and so our results should be interpreted cautiously [19, 20]. Likewise, operation time, postoperative pain, shoulder tip pain, and dry mouth were all reduced in deep group but should also be inter-preted cautiously, and further study is needed.\nIn conclusion, maintaining intraoperative deep neuro-muscular blockade and performing reversal with sugam-madex at the end of surgery reduced the rate of conversion to standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum and increased surgeon satisfaction with the surgical conditions while providing more rapid recovery at the end of surgery than did moderate blockade with neostigmine reversal in patients undergoing low-pressure pneumoperitoneum LC.

The treated group showed a better TOF ratio at extubation (P,0.001) and a more rapid discharge to the surgical ward than controls (P,0.001) (Table 1).\nIn eight cases, sugammadex was used for reversal of NMB at the end of surgery because of diffcult airway manage-ment at induction of anesthesia. In two cases, sugammadex was successfully used intraoperatively as rescue therapy for immediate reversal of a high-dose rocuronium-induced NMB for CVCI situation.\nPatients undergoing general anesthesia with rocuronium-induced NMB who received sugammadex for treatment of PORC-related AREs (“curative” use) were 3.2% of the cases (96 of 3,017 [cases treated with rocuronium]) (Table 2). PORC-related AREs included both diffcult weaning (2% of cases) and postextubation AREs (1.2% of cases). The treated group showed a worse TOF ratio at the end of surgery than controls (Table 2). In the treated group, the occurrence of an ARE was signifcantly associated with longer surgi-cal procedures (P,0.001), higher dosage of rocuronium \n(P,0.001), repeated doses of rocuronium (P,0.001), and shorter time between the last dose of rocuronium and tracheal extubation (P,0.001). The most frequent PORC-related AREs were diffcult weaning from mechanical ventilation (60.4%), postextubation severe hypoxemia (19.8%), inability to breathe deeply (9.4%), upper airway obstruction (5.2%), signs of respiratory distress (3.1%), and respiratory failure requiring mask ventilation (2%). In the treated group, the PORC-related AREs did not prolong the RR stay, as the time to discharge from the RR was similar in the treated and control groups (Table 2). Sugammadex administration showed not only reduction of the probability of delayed dis-charge to the surgical ward after 1 hour (Figure 1A and B) but also reduction in PORC-related ICU admissions. Ten PORC-related unplanned ICU admissions were registered in the 2011–2012 period and one in the 2013–2014 period. No unplanned ICU admissions with rocuronium–neostigmine– sugammadex strategy were observed. No adverse drug reactions related to drugs used for NMB management were registered.\n \nTable 1 Data for “preventive” use of sugammadex in high-risk patients and comparison with a control group\n \nTreated groupa	b 	P-value\n 	Control group	\n(128 patients)	(128 patients)	\n \n\n \nsex (male/female), n (%)	60 (46.8)/68 (53.2)	57 (44.5)/71 (55.5)	0.8\nage, years, mean  sD	6415	6214	0.58\nWeight, kg, mean  sD	8825	8422	0.18\nheight, cm, mean  sD	1748	1729	0.14\nReversal in patients with diffcult airways, n (%)c			\n	8 (6.2)	4 (3.1)	0.37\nelderly subjects ($75 yr), n (%)	27 (21)	27 (21)	1.0\nMorbid obesity (BMi .35), n (%)	36 (28.1)	36 (28.1)	1.0\nrespiratory disease, n (%)d			\n	10 (7.8)	15 (11.7)	0.4\ncardiac disease, n (%)e			\n	14 (10.9)	19 (14.8)	0.45\nKidney disease, n (%)f			\n	22 (17.1)	16 (12.5)	0.38\ncirrhosis, n (%)	4 (3.1)	7 (5.4)	0.54\nneuromuscular disease, n (%)g			\n	3 (2.3)	4 (3.1)	1.0\ncontraindications to neostigmine/atropine, n (%)	4 (3.1)	0 (0)	0.12\nDuration of surgery, min, mean  sD	15392	162111	0.45\nDuration of anesthesia, min, mean  sD	17498	192121	0.17\ninhalational anesthesia/TiVa, n (%)h			\n	102 (79.6)/26 (20.4)	96 (75)/32 (25)	0.45\nintraoperative analgesia (remifentanil/fentanyl), n (%)	91 (71.1)/37 (28.9)	84 (65.6)/44 (34.4)	0.42\nDegree of nMB at extubation, n (%)i			\n acceptable, n (%)	128 (100)	71 (55.5)	,0.001\n Mild-to-moderate, n (%)	0 (0)	41 (32)	,0.001\n severe, n (%)	0 (0)	16 (12.5)	,0.001\nrr length of stay, min, mean  sD	5629	10352	,0.001\n \nNotes: aa badministration of neostigmine for reversal of rocuronium-induced nMB. cr\ndministration of sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium-induced nMB. eversal of \nd\nNMB at the end of surgery in patients with diffcult mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation observed at induction of anesthesia.

The number of procedures in all groups increased between 2011–2012 and 2013–2014: ga with nMB (P,0.0001); ga without nMB (P,0.0001), and ra (P0.0071). chi-square tests were performed using the chi2cdf function in MaTlaB version r2014b (The Mathworks; natick, Ma, Usa). *P,0.05 was considered statistically signifcant.\nAbbreviations: ga, general anesthesia; nMB, neuromuscular blockade; ra, regional anesthesia.\nConsidering that in the University Hospital of Padova the OR cost (€6.6/min) includes also the OR staff cost (€3.72/ min), the gain in shorter OR stay based on OR cost was esti-mated to be €18,064 as obtained by calculating the difference between the loss of gain associated to neostigmine (€19,727) and sugammadex (€1,663) (Table 4 and Figure 4). Based on RR staff cost, the gain in shorter RR stay was estimated to be €2,105.6, considering the mean difference time of RR stay (Table 2). The total gain was then €20,169.6 which is derived from the sum of estimated gains in OR (€18,064) \n \n\n \ntwo time periods (Figure 2). The increased use of rocuronium (€1.85/vial), which is less expensive than cisatracurium (€6.25/vial), induced by introduction of sugammadex, allowed the reduction of the average cost of NMB management by 36%, from €20.8/case to €13.3/case. The sugammadex cost for “preventive” use was €19,987 (272 vials), for “curative” use was €7,056 (96 vials), and for “emergency use” was €882 (12 total vials). In the last situation, as recommended by the manufacturer, sugammadex 16 mg/kg was administered for \nand in RR (€2,105.6). The fnal analysis, in which the cost of neostigmine for “preventive” use (€94) was excluded, showed a cost of €154.7/case and an estimated gain of €157.6/case, with a net cost-saving of €2.9/case.\nThe average cost of ICU stay was estimated to be €1,354.8/day (range from €931.6/day to €2384.5/day).

Respiratory complications such as pneumonia and post-extuba-tion respiratory failure represent the second most common type of postoperative complication after wound infection.1–3 More-over, post-extubation respiratory failure has been shown to be one of the most signiﬁcant factors associated with poor patient outcomes, leading to a longer hospital stay,2–4 and increased ﬁ-nancial cost.12\nNeuromuscular blockers (NMBs) are commonly used during induction of anaesthesia to facilitate intubation, and optimize surgical conditions. However use of NMBs has been associated with negative side effects, and we recently demonstrated an in-creased incidence of postoperative respiratory failure, expressed as re-intubation and unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admis-sion post-surgery, after use of intermediate-acting NMBs.5 These complications translated to a 90-fold increase in mortality,5 and are likely to have resulted from lingering effects of NMBs, leading to residual neuromuscular blockade in the recovery room. Residual neuromuscular blockade occurs in approximately 20–60% of patients at arrival in the post-anaesthesia care unit\n67and\n(PACU) , is associated with an increased incidence of post-operative hypoxemia, pneumonia, and atelectasis in the post-operative period8–10 and an increased length of stay in the PACU.6 To decrease the likelihood of residual neuromuscular blockade after surgery, intra-operative monitoring of neuromus-cular transmission may be performed, to allow the NMB to be ti-trated to the desired effect during surgery and conﬁrm recovery from neuromuscular blockade before extubation.11 Acetylcholi-nesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine may also be adminis-tered at the end of surgery, to reverse the neuromuscular blockade. However, neostigmine is unable to effectively reverse deep concentrations of neuromuscular blockade,12 and addition-ally may be associated with both nicotinic and muscarinic side effects.13 14 Furthermore, neostigmine has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative de-oxygenation and atelec-tasis.51516In contrast to neostigmine, sugammadex reverses any degree of rocuronium or vecuronium-induced blockade by encapsulating the NMB, thereby inactivating it.17–20\nWe therefore investigated whether sugammadex reduces the incidence of post-surgical residual neuromuscular blockade upon arrival in the PACU, compared with usual care.\nInstitutional Review Board of the Massachusetts General Hos-pital, Boston, MA, USA (unique identiﬁer: NCT01479764).

Patients were excluded if they used any other investigational drugs within 30 days of randomization, or participated in another clinical trial within 30 days.\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either sugamma-dex or neostigmine/glycopyrrolate. Before study activation, a sample of 200 sealed envelopes were prepared by the sponsor: 100 for the sugammadex group and 100 for the neostigmine/gly-copyrrolate group.

According to the response to train-of-four (TOF) and post-tetanic-count stimulation, two depths of neuromuscular blockade were deﬁned: moderate (TOF count 1 to 3 in response to TOF stimulation), or deep [no response to TOF stimulation; but a response to post-tetanic-count (≥1)]. Sugammadex was to be administered at a dose of 2 mg kg−1 if spontaneous recovery had reached moderate neuromuscular blockade, or at a dose of\n−1 if recovery had reached deep neuromuscular blockade. 4mgkg\nAdministration and dosing of neostigmine/glycopyrrolate was consistent with the centre’s usual care practice and according to the product label(s) for reversal, with a maximum dose of\n−1). 5 mg (that is a neostigmine dose between 17.1–84.8µgkg The appropriate timing of administration of either NMB or rever-sal agent or extubation was based on the decision of the anaes-thesiologist. A TOF ratio was recorded for each patient within 5 min of arrival to the PACU by an assessor blinded to the study treatment. The TOF-watch was calibrated in each patient before performing the measurements. The stimulation current was set to30mAandtheTOF-watchSXwascalibratedinthecalibration1 mode.21\nThisTOFratioindicatedthelevelofrecoveryfromneuro-muscular blockade at PACU entry.\nStudy endpoints\nThe primaryendpoint wasthe presence of residual neuromuscu-lar blockade, deﬁned as a TOF ratio <0.9 on arrival to the PACU.\nThe keysecondaryendpoint wasthe time from start of study medication administration, to the time the patient was ready for discharge from the operating room, deﬁned as the time point deemed by the providing anaesthesiologist medically ap-propriate for the patient to leave the operating room. Based on the standard of care at the clinical site, the patients were required to have a regular breathing pattern, with stable oxygen saturation and stable haemodynamics to be considered discharge-ready.\nExploratory endpoints relating to surgical efﬁciency para-meters were also measured.\nStatistics\nAll analyses were conducted for the intention-to-treat popula-tion, which comprised all patients who received a dose of study medication. For the primary endpoint, patients were also re-quired to have a reliable TOF ratio measurement at PACU entry for analysis.\nFor the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, the odds ratio of having residual neuromuscular blockade was analysed for sugammadex vs usual care, with the exact 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for the odds ratio and P value calculated by Pearson χ2 test.22\nFor the key secondary endpoint analysis, time from start of study drug administration to the patient being considered ready for operating room discharge, was analysed with analysis of covariance, where the assigned treatment group was the main predictor in the model, and age, ASAClass, BMI, comorbid-ity index, and length of surgical procedure were added as covari-ates. Times were log transformed before inclusion in the model, as these times are considered to follow an approximately lognormal distribution. Non-parametric analysis using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed as a secondary (sensitiv-ity) analysis. This test was also used to compare TOF values before reversal between the two groups.\nCategorical data were presented as percentage (frequency) and continuous data as mean, standard deviation (), unless otherwise speciﬁed. All time intervals were presented as geo-metric means and associated 95% CI. A sample size of 71 pa-tients per treatment group was determined to have a power of 85%, showing a signiﬁcant difference (α=0.05) in the incidence of TOF ratio <0.9 between both groups. It was assumed that TOF ratio <0.9 incidence would be 5% in the sugammadex group and 22% in the usual care group.623The investigators aimed to enrol 75 patients for both groups in case of missing data.\nAll statistical analyses and tests were performed using SAS (v 9.1.3, Cary, NC). A two-sided P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.\n \n\n \nSafety assessments	Results\n \n\n \nSafety assessments were conducted by a blinded safety assessor. Each patient underwent a physical examination at screening and at the post-anaesthetic visit (at least 10 h after administration of sugammadex or neostigmine/glycopyrrolate). Vital signs were recorded at screening. Beats min -1 and bp were recorded at regu-lar intervals and changes of >20% from baseline were considered signiﬁcant.Continuouselectrocardiogramandoxygensaturation (Sp ) monitoring were performed throughout anaesthesia and\nO2\npostoperatively, in accordance with standard clinical practice. In the PACU, vital signs were recorded on admission, at 5 min and 15 min after admission, and then every 15 min thereafter until 120 min, or discharge from the PACU. Any possible indica-tions of partial neuromuscular blockade (e.g. change in respira-tory rate or decrease in Sp level attributed to residual\nO2\nneuromuscular blockade) occurring during the time between ad-ministration of the reversal agent until PACU discharge were recorded.\nThe safety assessor, blinded to both study drug and efﬁcacy measurement results, followed-up on all patients for adverse events (AEs), and serious AEs. The assessor visited the patient in the PACU and on postoperative day 1 and followed-up with the patient 7 days after surgery, either in person or on the telephone.\nIn total, 74 patients received sugammadex and 77 patients received usual care and were included in the all-patients-as-treated analysis (Fig. 1, Table 1).\nResidual neuromuscular blockade at PACU entry\nA TOF ratio for assessment of recovery from neuromuscular blockade was obtained at PACU arrival for all patients in the su-gammadex arm (n=74) and for all patients except one in the usual care arm (n=76). This patient was admitted to ICU after sur-gery, instead of the PACU.\nA total of 33 patients had residual neuromuscular blockade at PACU entry, all of whom were in the usual care group (0% vs 43% comparing sugammadex with usual care, P<0.0001) (Fig. 2). The exact 95% CI for the odds ratio of residual neuromuscular block-ade with sugammadex vs usual care was 0.00 to 0.06. ATOF ratio of ≤0.7 at PACU entry was reported foreight (10.5%) patients from the usual care group (Fig. 2).\nSimilarly, the average level of neuromuscular blockade recov-ery upon PACU entry was signiﬁcantly higher in the sugamma-dex group compared with the usual care group, demonstrated by a mean () TOF ratio of 1.07±0.09 vs 0.90±0.17, P=<0.0001 (Fig. 3).\n \n746 | Brueckmann et al.\n \nEnrolled (n=183)\n \nDiscontinued before randomization:\n– Administrative reasons (n=3)\n– Did not meet in/exclusion criteria (n=21)\n– Withdrew consent (n=5)\n \n	Randomized (n=154)	\nSugammadex (n=76)		Usual care (n=78)\n \n\n \nDiscontinued before treatment:	Discontinued before treatment:\n– Adverse event (n=1)	– Adverse event (n=1)\n– Withdrew consent (n=1)	\n \n\n \n	Received study drug	\nn=74		n=77\n \n– Unplanned admission\n   to intensive care unit (n=1)\n \n	Primary endpoint available	\nn=74		n=76\n \nSafety assessments\n \n	1-day follow-up	\nn=74		n=77\n \n– Lost to follow-up (n=2)\n \n	7-day follow-up	\nn=74		n=75\n \nFig 1 Patient ﬂow chart (in accordance with CONSORT guidelines).\n \nGeometric mean (95% CI) times from study drug administra- (P=0.17), reversal was given either in the absence of documented tion to operating room discharge readiness were 14.7 (13.1–16.4) TOF-count or at a documented deep neuromuscular block (TOF-min and 18.6 (16.6–20.8) min, for sugammadex vs neostigmine, count 0 or 1).\nrespectively P=0.02).

In the\n \nSugammadex elimination of residual blockade | 749\n \nsugammadex group, the AE was cough, of mild intensity. In the usual care group, there were seven AEs in this class: one patient each with transient apnoea (3 min), cough, hypoventilation, ob-structive airways disorder, oropharyngeal discomfort, and two patients with rales; all of mild or moderate intensity. Findings of decreased Sp were observed for one (1.4%) patient in the su-\nO2\ngammadex group, vs two (2.6%) in the usual care group.\nNo AEs led to discontinuation of a treated patient from the study. Furthermore, no serious AEs suggestive of hypersensitiv-ity and/or suspected events of anaphylaxis were reported, and no deaths, serious trial procedure-related, or medical device-re-lated events were reported during the study.\nDiscussion\nThe use of sugammadex for neuromuscular blockade reversal at the end of surgery was shown to eliminate residual blockade at PACU admission while, in contrast, 43% of patients treated with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate had a TOF ratio <0.9 at PACU arrival, 11% even a TOF ratio <0.7. The mean () TOF ratio at PACU entry was signiﬁcantly higher in the sugammadex group, compared with neostigmine (1.07±0.09 vs 0.90±0.17, respectively; P<0.0001).\nThe TOF-Watch-derived diagnosis of residual blockade translated into clinically signiﬁcant symptoms of muscular weakness in two patients in the usual care group, considered probably drug-related by the investigator. While clinical signs ofresidual neuromuscularblock maynotalwaysbereliable,clin-ical diagnosis of postoperative muscle weakness could be attrib-uted to residual neuromuscular blockade, because signs and symptoms of muscle weakness were associated with TOF ratios of 0.53 and 0.74, respectively, at PACU arrival.21 After a total dose of 140 mg rocuronium, one patient developed signs and symp-toms of respiratory distress, 57 min after the ﬁrst administration of 3.5 mg neostigmine. The last TOF count measured and docu-mented before reversal was 0. A previous study demonstrated that the maximum effect of neostigmine reversal decreases by about 25% within an hour.25 We speculate that recurrence may have been a contributing mechanism of respiratory distress in this patient, based onthe combinationof high-dose rocuronium, development of muscle weakness one h after neostigmine, and prompt improvement of symptoms after a second dose of neostigmine.\nIn the second patient, the effects of high-dose rocuronium (150mg)wereintendedtobeantagonizedwithhighdoseneostig-mine (5 mg). For this patient a TOF-count of 2 was documented 15 min before reversal. These two patients underline the clinical relevance of residual neuromuscular blockade and the import-ance of using neuromuscular transmission monitoring, to docu-mentrecoveryofneuromusculartransmissionbeforeextubation. No patients with clinical evidence of residual neuromuscular blockade or recurrence ofneuromuscular blockadewere reported in the sugammadex group.\nThe use of modern intermediate acting NMBs has been showntobeassociatedwithanincreasedriskofpostoperativere-\n726which sidual neuromuscular blockade in the PACU, can re-present a considerable safety risk in patients recovering from surgery. Residual neuromuscular blockade has previously been shown to be present in 45% of patients arriving at the PACU, after a single dose of an intermediate-acting NMB.27 Lingering effects of NMBs may increase the risk of developing respiratory complications in the PACU, particularly in susceptible patients.5 Residualblockadeleadstodysfunctionoftherespiratorymuscles and functional impairment of the muscles of the pharynx and\nupper oesophagus, and a reduced ventilator response to hyp-\n–10 28 Traditionally, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such oxia.58\nas neostigmine have been used to reduce residual neuromuscu-lar blockade in the postoperative period. However, Grosse-Sundr-up and colleagues5 found that use of neostigmine in a real-world scenario of a busy operating room, increased the risk of oxygen desaturation in the early postoperative period.515Thismaybe at-tributable to the attempts of antagonizing deep blockade that typically result in incomplete recovery,15 as neostigmine cannot effectively antagonize deep levels of neuromuscular blockade.12 Sugammadex is not known to be associated with any respiratory complications. In contrast to neostigmine, which signiﬁcantly impaired upper dilator muscle when given for neuromuscular blockade reversal, sugammadex was associated with no such re-spiratorysideeffects.29 Sugammadexisregisteredforuseinmore than 70 countries worldwide and has been approved in the European Union since 2008. Sugammadex has been shown to result in 3 to 18 times faster reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, compared with neostigmine12 18 30 and 69 times faster vs placebo.20\nAweakness ofthecurrentstudywasthatit wasnotsufﬁcient-ly powered to identify differences in incidence of postoperative respiratory complications. The incidence of severe respiratory complications is generally low after surgery; an example is post-operative respiratory failure requiring re-intubation, which was recently found to be 0.41%.31 Conservatively assuming an inci-dence of 6% in the neostigmine group vs 3% in the sugammadex group, it is estimated that, for a power of 80% to statistically de-tect a difference in postoperative respiratory complications be-tween patients administered sugammadex vs usual care, a total of ≥1600 subjects would be required.\nOur study design might have contributed to our ﬁnding a lower incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade in the sugammadex group compared with the neostigmine group. In fact, anaesthesia providers were given directions on how to use sugammadex, whereas neostigmine dosing was kept at the dis-cretion of the anaesthesiologist. In one third of patients in the neostigmine group, the reversal agent was administered in an unwarranted fashion,16 deﬁned as administration either in the absence of a documented TOF-count, or at a documented deep\n16\nneuromuscularblockade(TOF-count0or1). This inadequate use of neostigmine may translate to postoperative respiratory failure.16 Other data suggest that it is possible that anaesthesia providersusesugammadexinanunwarrantedfashion(e.g.with-out TOF-monitoring, or by using an inadequate dose). It was re-ported in an effectiveness study that residual neuromuscular blockade occurred in about 5% of patients after sugammadex ad-ministration without TOF-monitoring.32 Of note, recurarisation or incomplete reversal after sugammadex, can only occur when the number of circulating sugammadex molecules is not sufﬁ-cient to bind to a critical number of rocuronium molecules, pre-sentinthebody.Onemoleculeofsugammadexencapsulates one molecule of rocuronium: for instance, 200 mg of sugamma-dex i.v. binds to 55 mg of rocuronium i.v. When a large dose of rocuronium is given followed by an inadequate dose of sugam-madex, it is possible that previously redistributed rocuronium mightbemobilized,toproducedelayedneuromuscularblockade, as has been previously described by Plaud and co-workers.33 Accordingly, the absence of evidence of residual blockade after sugammadex, as shown in our study, does not implicate evi-dence of absence of any risk of residual paralysis when sugam-madex is given. Quantitative neuromuscular transmission monitoring is the only way to exclude residual neuromuscular blockade at the end of the procedure.\n \n750 | Brueckmann et al.\n \nWe performed TOF-measurements in awake patients. We cannot exclude the possibility that these measurements were in-ﬂuenced by either voluntary or non-voluntary movements of the patienttowhich thethumbmaybesubject.34\nTOF-ratiomeasure-ments in awake patients have been assessed in several prior studies.635\nFurthermore, in our clinical practice, clinical deci-sions of diagnosis of residual neuromuscular blockade in the PACU are made based on TOF-ratio measurements in awake pa-tients.Tominimizetheriskforpotential biasthepatient andTOF assessor were blinded to the study drug.\nIn the present study, the time between reversal agent admin-istration and operating room discharge-readiness wasshorterfor sugammadex vs usual care, indicating accelerated neuromuscu-lar function recovery in the operating room and increased surgi-cal efﬁciency. Rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade may be cost-effective, if rapid recovery of muscle strength can be translated into a reduction of recovery time in routine clinical practice,24\nalthough further studies are needed.\nIn summary, in this trial reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex eliminated residual neuromuscular blockade and associated clinically meaningful symptoms of partial paralysis.\nAuthors’ contributions\nB.B. and N.S. contributed to data acquisition and writing of the manuscript.P.G.,M.K.L.and A.K.S-R.contributedtothestatistical analysisandwriting of manuscript.

Trial Registration\n \nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02109133\n \nIntroduction\n \nRobotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) is frequently used and advanced\nsurgical technique in current practice.[1] Because RALRP has to be performed in a limited\nretroperitoneal space, insufflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide (CO ) pneumoperito-\n2\nneum and the steep Trendelenburg (ST) position are required to ensure a better surgical view.\n[2]\nHowever, CO pneumoperitoneum at a high intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) combined\n2\nwith the ST position not only causes adverse hemodynamic effects [3] but also increases the\nintraocular pressure (IOP), which may result in severe ophthalmic damage such as ischemic\noptic neuropathy.[4,5] Despite its rare incidence, ophthalmic damage after RALRP could be\nthe severe outcome. Therefore, the clinical importance of the prevention of IOP increase dur-\ning RALRP cannot be emphasized enough.[6]\nThe European Association for Endoscopic Surgery recommends the use of the lowest IAP\n(rather than routine pressures) for adequate exposure of the surgical field.[7] Therefore, ade-\nquate working space should always be achieved with careful consideration of IAP for the\npatient’s safety.[8] Recent studies reported that deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB)\nimproved surgical conditions,[9–11] even during low-pressure laparoscopic surgeries.[12–14]\nHowever, no study has evaluated the effects of the surgical conditions under deep NMB on\nIOP during RALRP.\nTherefore, this study assessed the hypothesis that continuous deep NMB improves the sur-\ngical conditions and facilitates RALRP at a low IAP, which, in turn, attenuates the increase in\nIOP during CO pneumoperitoneum in the ST position. The level of surgeon satisfaction with\n2\nthe surgical conditions at a low IAP was also evaluated.\n \nPatients and Methods\n \nThe protocol for this trial and the CONSORT checklist are available as Supporting Information\nfiles (S1 CONSORT Checklist, S1 and S2 Protocols).\n \nStudy population\n \nThis prospective, randomized, double blind trial was conducted at the Severance Hospital,\nYonsei University Health System, Seoul, Republic of Korea between April 2014 and December\n2014. Approval of study protocol was obtained from the Institutional Review Board and Hospi-\ntal Research Ethics Committee of Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Health System on\nMarch 2014, and was subsequently registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (registration number\nNCT02109133).

Patients who had undergone previous ophthalmic surgery or were taking medications for\nglaucoma, those with current ophthalmic disease (glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, cataract,\nand retinal detachment), and those with a baseline IOP of >30 mmHg were excluded. Patients\nwith a history of allergy to sugammadex or neuromuscular blocking agents, known or sus-\npected neuromuscular diseases, past history of retroperitoneal surgery, hypersensitivity to\nanesthetic agents, uncontrolled hypertension, liver or kidney disease, previous or familial his-\ntory of malignant hyperthermia, medications that interact with muscle relaxants (anticonvul-\nsants, certain antibiotics, magnesium, etc.), a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2, neurological\nor psychiatric illness, and mental retardation, as well as those incapable of reading the consent\nform because of illiteracy or language barriers, were excluded.\n \nRandomization and Allocation\n \nAfter enrollment, patients were randomly allocated to either deep NMB Group (Group D,\nn = 34) or moderate NMB group (Group M, n = 33) according to predetermined randomiza-\ntion sequence, which was generated in www.random.org with no dividing blocks and was cov-\nered up in a sealed envelope. An investigator who did not participate in IOP measurements\nand care of the enrolled patients performed patients’ enrollment and randomization, and pre-\npared all study medications according to the group allocation. The attending anesthetist who\nmanaged the patients in the operating room was also not blinded. However, the ophthalmo-\nlogic assessor, patients, surgical team, research team, and anesthetists who managed the\npatients in the recovery room were blinded to group allocation. The CONSORT Flow Diagram\nis reported in Fig 1.\n \nPerioperative Protocol\n \nPatients were administered 0.05 mg/kg of intramuscular midazolam as premedication. On\narrival in the operating room, routine monitoring of noninvasive arterial blood pressure, elec-\ntrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation (SpO ), and bispectral index (BIS) (Aspect A-2000;\n2\nAspect Medical System Inc., Newton, MA) were applied to the patient. Following the induction\nof general anesthesia with propofol (2 mg/kg) and remifentanil infusion (0.05–0.1 μg/kg/min),\nthe radial artery was catheterized for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and rep-\netition of blood gas analysis.\nMechanical ventilation was applied with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg ideal body weight in\n50% oxygen with air, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH O, and an inspiratory time:\n2\nexpiratory time ratio of 1:2. The respiratory rate was adjusted to 10–20 breaths/min to main-\ntain the end-tidal CO tension (ETCO )at35 42 mmHg. The maintenance of anesthesia was\n–\n2 2\nundergone with sevoflurane (0.6–2.3 age-adjusted minimal alveolar concentration) and remi-\nfentanil (0.03–0.1 μg/kg/min) to target BIS scores of 40 to 60. Neuromuscular monitoring was\nperformed using accelomyography (TOF-Watch SX, Organon Ltd, Ireland) of the corrugator\nsupercilli (CS) muscle. NMB agents (rocuronium or atracurium) were administered following\ncalibration and stabilization of the train of four (TOF)-Watch.\nThe patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups. Group D (deep NMB group)\nincluded patients who received an intravenous (IV) rocuronium bolus (1.0 mg/kg) following\nthe continuous infusion of 0.6 mg/kg until the end of the ST position. Dose titration was\nassigned to an attending anesthetist via regulation of the bolus infusion speed to maintain a\npost-tetanic count (PTC) of 1 to 2. Sugammadex was administered to reverse the effects of\nNMB after surgery. Group M (moderate NMB group) included patients who received an IV\n \nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0135412	August 28, 2015	3/14\n \nIntraocular Pressure under Deep Neuromuscular Blockade\n \nFig 1.

Dose titration was assigned to an attending anesthetist via regulation of the\nbolus infusion speed to maintain a TOF count of 1 to 2. Neostigmine was used to reverse the\neffects of NMB after surgery. TOF was assessed every 15 min, and PTC was assessed if TOF\nwas 0. Pneumoperitoneum was induced with CO insufflation of 20 mmHg. Following the\n2\ninsertion of trocars, an IAP of 8 mmHg was set from the previous 20 mmHg, and a remote con-\ntrol was used to place the patients in a precise 29° Trendelenburg position. All RALRP proce-\ndures were performed by a single experienced surgeon (Y.D.C) who was blinded to the group\nallocation.\nThe following steps were implemented in the event of insufficient surgical conditions in\nboth groups; the decision of the insufficient surgical condition was done by the surgeon.\n \n1.

The patient was extu-\nbated only after regaining consciousness and exhibiting a TOF ratio of > 0.9. After extubation,\nthe patients were monitored for a minimum of 60 min in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU).\nIn addition, postoperative pain was assessed using a verbal Numerical Rating Scale for pain\n(vNRS, 0 = no pain and10 = worst painimaginable) by blinded recovery nurses. Any postopera-\ntive respiratory events or known unfavorable events such as hypotension, dry mouth, nausea\nand vomiting, abdominal discomfort, headache, bradycardia, and dizziness were monitored.\n \nSample Size and Statistical Analysis\n \nIn a previous study [5], IOP under pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenberg position was\n19.9 ± 3.8 mmHg in a propofol-based total intravenous (TIVA) group and 23.5 ± 4.3 mmHg in\na sevoflurane inhalational anesthesia group. To detect a 3.6-mmHg difference in IOP, power\nestimation analysis suggested that 31 patients per group would be required to obtain a power\nof 90%, considering a type I error of 0.05. Considering a drop-out rate of 10%, we recruited 34\npatients in each group.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC,\nUSA) and IBM SPSS Statistics 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All continuous values were\nshown as mean ± SD or median (range), and the number of patients (%) was used for all cate-\ngorical values. Between-group comparisons of continuous variables were performed by inde-\npendent Student’s t-test. Repeated measured variables such as IOP, MBP, ETCO , and PIP\n2\nwere analyzed using a linear mixed model with the patient indicator as a random effect and\ngroup, time, and group-by-time as fixed effects. When the interaction of group, time, and\ngroup-by-time showed statistical significance, post hoc analysis was performed with Bonfer-\nroni correction for the adjustment for multiple comparisons. Analysis was performed using a\nunivariate linear mixed model to identify possible predictors of alteration in IOP over the T3–\nT4 period. Multivariate linear mixed model analysis was performed using variables that were\nstatistically significant in the univariate model at the 0.05 level. All statistical tests were two-\ntailed, and P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n \nResults\n \nFor eligibility, a total of 71 patients were screened, and four patients who did not meet the\ninclusion criteria because of two previous cataract surgeries, current glaucoma with medica-\ntion, and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2).\nFinally 67 patients were randomly assigned to the two\ngroups. One patient in Group M was dropped out because of acute uncontrolled bleeding dur-\ning surgery. Consequently, the remaining 66 patients (34 in Group D and 32 in Group M) were\nanalyzed, with no missing data (Fig 1).\nThe characteristics of the patients were comparable between groups (Table 2). The duration\nof anesthesia, surgery, pneumoperitoneum, and Trendelenburg were also similar between\ngroups.

The total CO amount was sig-\n2\nnificantly lower in Group D (407 ± 228 L) than in Group M (593 ± 248 L) (P = 0.003). Patients\nin Group D showed a TOF count of 0 and an average PTC of 1.6 ± 0.6, while those in Group M\nshowed a TOF count of 1.7 ± 0.3 (Table 3). The overall and worst surgical condition grades are\nalso shown in Table 3. There were significant differences in ratings between the two groups.\nThe overall surgical condition grade was 4.0 (3.0–5.0) in Group D and 3.0 (2.0–5.0) in Group\nM, while the worst surgical condition grade was 4.0 (2.0–5.0) in Group D and 2.0 (2.0–4.0) in\nGroup M (P < 0.001).\nRALRP was accomplished at an IAP of 8 mmHg in 30 (88%) patients of Group D compared\nwith 8 (25%) patients of Group M in 8mmHg of pneumoperitoneum. IAP was elevated to 10\nor 12 mmHg in the remaining 4 (12%) patients of Group D and up to 20mmHg in 2 (6%)\npatients of Group M, respectively, due to insufficient surgical conditions (Fig 3A). There were\nno differences in baseline IOP between the two groups. There was no patient who had baseline\nIOPs higher than 20 mmHg. The analysis with linear mixed model was shown that there was a\nsignificant intergroup difference in IOP over time (P = 0.0003) (Fig 3B). Even after post hoc\nanalysis with Bonferonni correction, IOP at T3 and T4 during pneumoperitoneum in the ST\nposition were significantly lower in Group D than in Group M (P < 0.001).\nExcept for PIP, there were no significant differences in MBP and EtCO between the two\n2\ngroups (Fig 4A and 4B). Fig 4C shows that there was a significant difference in PIP over time\nbetween the two groups through the linear mixed model analysis (P = 0.0006). Post hoc analy-\nsis with Bonferonni correction indicated that PIP at T2, T3, and T4 were significantly lower in\nGroup D than in Group M (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.0375, respectively). In addition, IAP at\nT3 and T4 showed significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.001) (Fig 4D).\nAs shown in Table 4, there were no significant differences in the postoperative respiratory\nvariables, with the exception of SpO and degree of dry mouth (Table 4). Vomiting did not\n2\noccur in any of the patients, while nausea occurred in 4 patients in Group M and 1 patient in\nGroup D, with no significant difference. Postoperative pain as assessed by v-NRS was also com-\nparable between groups. Finally, there was no patient who suffered from ocular complications\nand hemodynamic instability.\n \nDiscussion\n \nThe current study demonstrated that continuous deep NMB may facilitate RALRP under a low\nIAP, resulting in improvement of surgical conditions and significant attenuation of the IOP\n \nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0135412	August 28, 2015	7/14\n \nIntraocular Pressure under Deep Neuromuscular Blockade\n \nTable 3.

Furthermore, low pressure pneu-\n2\nmoperitoneum, facilitated by deep NMB still provided satisfactory surgical conditions.\nIn order to have adequate working space for optimal surgical view and no difficulty in lapa-\nroscopic device handling, CO pneumoperitoneum is required during laparoscopic surgery.\n2\n[15–17] Furthermore, RALRP requires the ST position and, frequently, a high insufflation\npressure for optimal surgical view, which causes an increase in IOP.[4,5] Also, the majority of\npatients undergoing RALRP are older with various comorbidities, which will leave the patient\nprone to the consequent ocular damage due to the increased IOP. [18–20]\nSeveral factors affect the working space during laparoscopic surgery.[8] It is commonly\nbelieved that a higher pneumoperitonuem pressure results in better exposure of the surgical\nfield.[21] However, the increase in pressure at a low IAP offers a better working space com-\npared with that at a high IAP.[8] This is because the compliance of the abdominal wall\ndecreases at a high IAP.[22,23] From this perspective, several studies regarding the feasibility\nand advantages of low-pressure laparoscopic surgery have been conducted.[24–27] Recently,\nstudies reported that deep NMB helps in improving the quality of the surgical view,[9–11] even\nduring low-pressure laparoscopic surgeries.[12–14] However, to the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first study regarding the influence of the surgical conditions under continuous deep\nNMB on IOP in the ST position under pneumoperitoneum during RALRP.\nA significantly greater number of procedures were successfully completed in Group D\n(88%) than in Group M (25%) at 8 mmHg, with the success rate in Group D being similar to\nthat in previous reports (about 70% to 100%) comparing postoperative pain between low-pres-\nsure and standard-pressure laparoscopic surgeries.[24,26] However, in Group M, 75% patients\nshowed an IAP increase adjustment. The average mean (SD) IAPs at T3 and T4 were 11.7 ± 3.4\nand 12.6 ± 3.5 in Group M and 8.3 ± 1.0 and 8.5 ± 1.3 in Group D, respectively, which were\nlower than those used (15–18 mmHg) during conventional RALRP.[3,5,28 Fig 4D).\n](\n \nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0135412	August 28, 2015	8/14\n \nIntraocular Pressure under Deep Neuromuscular Blockade\n \nFig 3.

Multivariate analysis revealed that the only signif-\nicant predictor of IOP was IAP (slope coefficient, 0.5178; P < 0.0001). A possible explanation\nmay be that a low IAP led to a decrease in the peritoneal CO absorption and PIP, which may\n2\nhave attenuated the IOP increase.\nAll RALRP procedures were performed by a single surgeon with ample experience. Before\nthis study, he had performed RALRP on 20 mmHg of pneumoperitoneum pressure during tro-\ncar insertion, and after the ST position, the pressure was decreased to 15 mmHg. However, IAP\nwould be adjusted up to 20 mmHg in the event of uncontrolled bleeding or inadequate surgical\nconditions. Even though a new trial was required for this study, there were no significant differ-\nences between the first 34 and the last 34 procedures.\nIn regards to depth of NMB, the monitoring of adductor pollicis (AP) muscle has been\napplied as a validated method.[29,30] However, in the present study, the patients’ arm lay\nalongside the torso, and was covered by a surgical drape to prevent interference with the\nrobotic arms. As an alternative method, the CS muscle offers a better reflection of the larynx\nand diaphragm.[31,32] Therefore, we measured the depth of NMB at the CS muscle instead of\nthe AP muscle. This could be a limitation of our study. When measuring the depth of NMB at\nthe CS muscle using acceleromyography, concomitant signals from the orbicularis oculi are\ninevitable, resulting in a mixed signal.[31] In addition, higher current is thought to be required\nto provoke maximal facial muscle contractions,[31] which could exacerbate the problem of\ndirect muscle stimulation. However, we believe that the effect of this was minimized as a con-\nstant degree of NMB was maintained in each group.\nThe Other limitations of our study are as follows. It has been demonstrated that a low-pres-\nsure pneumoperitoneum can lead to a reduction in postoperative pain compared with a stan-\ndard-pressure pneumoperitoneum.[24–27] In the current study however, there was no\nsignificant difference in postoperative pain between the two groups. This may be because IAP,\neven in Group M, was less than 12mmHg, which was defined as the standard pressure in previ-\nous studies.[24,25] Third, the scale used to evaluate the surgical conditions was more subjective\ncompared with that used in previous studies.[12,14] We rated the overall and worst surgical\nconditions at the end of the ST position, whereas previous studies rated the surgical conditions\nat a regular time interval throughout the surgery. More objective and concrete measures are\nthus required for more precise results. Finally, in case of poor surgical conditions, no rescue\ndoses of muscle relaxants or increased doses of general anesthetics was administered. Instead,\nIAP was increased from 8 mmHg to 10 mmHg to 12 mmHg to 15 mmHg to 20 mmHg (maxi-\nmum) to improve the surgical conditions in both groups, whenever the surgeon felt uncom-\nfortable or needed an adjustment during surgery. Although we assessed the depth of NMB\nevery 15 min in both groups, there could have been occasions of inadequate NMB depth. Also,\nbecause a constant level of anesthesia was maintained, the effect of anesthesia depth on the sur-\ngical conditions was not evaluated.\nActually, With the exception of the surgeon’s satisfaction in this study, it is difficult to con-\nclude that deep NMB is superior from an anaesthesiology point of view. However, considering\nthe adverse effects of pneumoperitoneum and IOP increases in elderly patients undergoing\nRALRP, we believe that surgical conditions under low-pressure, facilitated by deep NMB may\nhave clinical significance from both the anaesthetic and surgical perspective.\nIn conclusion, continuous deep NMB may lead to the improvement of surgical conditions\nand facilitate RALRP at low IAP levels, which may contribute to the significant attenuation of\nthe IOP increase during pneumoperitoneum in the ST position. Further clinical studies are\nrequired for other types of surgeries to further clarify the effectiveness of deep NMB.\n \nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0135412	August 28, 2015	11 / 14\n \nIntraocular Pressure under Deep Neuromuscular Blockade\n \nSupporting Information\n \nS1 CONSORT Checklist.

Previous\nstudies suggest that sugammadex is effective in reversing\nmoderate neuromuscular block in the presence of renal\nfailure, but no data are available regarding reversal of pro-\nfound neuromuscular block in patients with renal failure.\nOBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to compare the\nefﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex in reversing profound\nneuromuscular block induced by rocuronium in patients with\nend-stage renal disease and those with normal renal function.\nDESIGN A prospective clinical trial.\nSETTING Two university hospitals, from 1 October 2011 to\n31 January 2012.\nPATIENTS Forty patients undergoing kidney transplant: 20\n<30mlmin 1\nwith renal failure [creatinine clearance (ClCr) ]\n>90mlmin 1\nand 20 control patients (ClCr ).\nthree responses) was maintained during surgery.

It was also reviewed and\napproved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital\nGeneralUniversitarioStaLuciadeCartagena,Cartagena,\nSpain in September 2011 (Chairperson Dr Manuel\nNombela ´z). The study was registered at Clinical\nGome\nTrials.gov (number NCT01785758) and was conducted\nin compliance with the current revision of the Declara-\ntion of Helsinki and the International Conference on\nHarmonization Guideline for good clinical practice in\npharmacodynamic studies of NMBAs.4\nPatients were eligible for the trial if they were aged\nbetween18and65years,werehavinggeneralanaesthesia\nfor kidney transplantation with a kidney from a deceased\ndonor and required the administration of muscle relaxant\ndrugs. The patients were 20 ASA (American Society of\nAnesthesiologists physical status classiﬁcation) class I or\nII control patients with normal renal function [creatinine\nclearance (ClCr) >90mlmin 1\n) and 20 ASA class III\n–1\npatients with renal failure (ClCr <30mlmin ) on dialy-\nsis for at least 3 months. The Cockcroft–Gault formula\nwas used to calculate creatinine clearance.5\nThe data\nfrom patients with chronic renal disease were collected\nat the Hospital do Rim e ˜o – Fundac˜o\nHipertensa ¸a\nOswaldo Ramos (Sao Paulo, Brazil), and the data from\npatients with preserved renal function were collected at\nHospital General Universitario Santa ´a de Carta-\nLucı\ngena, Cartagena, Spain) between 1 October 2011 and\n31 January 2012. Exclusion criteria included previous\nneuromuscular disease, liver failure, history of malignant\nhyperthermia, allergy to opioids or neuromuscular block-ers, pregnancy and current use of anticonvulsants, mag-nesium or aminoglycosides. All patients provided written informed consent.\nStudy procedures\nOnce in the operating room, all enrolled patients received 1 to 2mg of intravenous (i.v.) midazolam before induction of anaesthesia and were monitored with ECG, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, capnography, core body temperature (measured by an\noesophageal probe), peripheral body temperature\n(measured by a sensor on the thenar eminence) and a bispectral index (BIS) depth of anaesthesia monitor\n(ASPECT BIS XP; Aspect Medical System Inc., One Upland Road, Norwood, Massachusetts, USA). Neuro-muscular function was monitoredcontinuously by accel-eromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle with\nTOF-Watch SX (Organon Ireland Ltd., Swords Co., Dublin, Ireland). The data were transferred to a com-puter using the TOF-Watch software ver. 3.1 (Organon Ireland Ltd.) for further analysis. The left arm was\npositioned at a 908 angle to the thorax, resting on an arm board. After cleaning the skin with gauze soaked in alcohol solution, paediatric ECG-electrodes were placed over the ulnar nerve near the wrist, ensuring their centres remained 3cm apart from each other. The\nacceleromyography transducer was attached to the dis-tal phalanx of the thumb, perpendicular to its move-ment. The other ﬁngers, as well as the arm, were\nimmobilised and ﬁxed to the arm board. Peripheral\ntemperature was maintained above 328Candwas\nmeasured on this same limb via a sensor attached to the palm. For haemodialysis patients, monitoring was\nperformed on the limb contralateral to the ﬁstula. Cen-tral core temperature was maintained above 358C.\nAfter a bolus of fentanyl (3 gkg 1), induction of\nm\nanesthesia was performed with a target-controlled infu-sion (TCI) of propofol (Marsh model, plasma target\n 1). After loss of consciousness\nconcentration ¼ 4 mgml\n(deﬁned as a BIS <60), 5s of 50Hz tetanic stimulation was applied followed by calibration of the acceleromyo-graphy transducer. After calibration, stimuli were applied every 15s using TOF pulses at 2Hz until a stable response was obtained [deﬁned as three consecutive TOF measurements where the TOF ratio {ratio of the fourth twitch (T ) to the ﬁrst twitch (T )–T/T } had a\n4 1 4 1\n2 Once calibration and maximum variation of  5%].\nstabilisation of the response was validated, TOF stimu-lation was performed every 15s using an automatically\ncalculated supramaximal stimulus of 0.2ms duration.\nA single i.v. dose of rocuronium (0.6mgkg 1) was admi-nistered over 5s and the time elapsed between the start of the injection and a 95% reduction in the ﬁrst twitch of\n \nEur J Anaesthesiol 2015; 32:681–686\nCopyright © European Society of Anaesthesiology.

Tracheal\nintubation was performed 1min after the initial dose\nirrespective of the TOF response. The NMB was main-\ntained with a continuous infusion of rocuronium, started\n15min after the initial dose. The infusion rate was\ninitially 4mgkg 1 h 1 and subsequently adjusted to\nmaintain neuromuscular blockade at a posttetanic count\n(PTC) of 1 to 3 until skin closure was complete. Anesthe-\nsia was maintained with TCI propofol and a remifentanil\n 1 and adjusted as necess-\ninfusion (initial rate 0.05 mgkg\nary) to maintain the BIS reading between 40 and 60,\nand mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60mmHg.\nAt the end of surgery, after completion of skin closure,\nall infusions were discontinued and sugammadex\n(4mgkg 1\n) was administered while the PTC was in\nthe range of one to three counts.\nVentilation of the lungs was with a mixture of air and\noxygen in equal volumes. The initial ventilatory\n 1, respiratory rate-\nparameters (tidal volume ¼ 7mlkg\n¼ 12breathsmin 1 and I:E ratio ¼ 1:2) were adjusted\nto maintain ETCO between 4.6 to 5.3kPa.\n2\nPostoperative analgesia was initiated with morphine\n(0.1mgkg 1\n) and metimazole (2g) administered i.v. at\nthe end of surgery.\nStatistical analysis\nThe sample size calculation was performed using the\nMedCalc Software 8.0 (www.medcalc.be), and was based\non an estimated maximum difference of 120s in the\nrecovery time of the TOF ratio to at least 0.9 between\nthe groups. For 90% power and considering the risk of a\ntype I error as a of 0.05 or less, and of committing type II\nerror as b of 0.10 or less, 18 patients in each group would\nbe required.\nThe analyses were performed using SPSS 17 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, Illinois, USA). For categorical variables, we\npresent absolute and relative frequencies and for numeri-\ncal variables, summary measures (mean, quartiles, mini-\nmum, maximum and standard deviation). Association\nbetween two categorical variables was tested using the\nChi-squareorFisherexacttest.Thecomparisonofmeans\nbetween the two groups was performed using the\nStudent’s t-test for independent samples, provided that\ndata were normally distributed (conﬁrmed by the Kol-\nmogorov–Smirnov test). If data were not distributed\nnormally, then the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test\nwas used. The paired Student’s t-test was used to evalu-\nate paired samples from the same patient. For the evalu-\nation of linear association between two variables, the\nPearson correlation was used.\n \n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety assessments\nThetotaldoseofrocuroniumusedandthedurationofthe\nprocedure were recorded.\nThe efﬁcacy of sugammadex was evaluated by measuring\nthe time, in minutes, from its administration until recov-\nery of the TOF ratio to 0.9. Secondary efﬁcacy variables\nwere time from administration of sugammadex until\nrecovery of the TOF ratio to 0.7 and 0.8.\nIn the postanesthetic recovery room, the safety of\nsugammadex was evaluated by monitoring neuromus-\ncular function every 15min for 2h after its adminis-\ntration. Recurrence of NMB was deﬁned as a decrease\nin the TOF ratio below 0.9 after complete recovery had\nbeen previously detected. We also monitored the oxy-\ngen saturation (SpO ), blood pressure and heart rate\n2\nat 2, 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120min after administration of\nsugammadex.\nResults\nThe study included 20 patients with chronic renal failure\nundergoing dialysis and 20 patients with normal renal\nfunction. In one patient in the renal failure group, the\nTOF-Watch failed after the administration of sugamma-\ndex. This failure occurred after recovery of the TOF ratio\nto 0.8. This case was excluded from further analysis\nas the device could not be replaced and neuromuscular\nfunction could not be monitored objectively in the\nrecovery unit.\nNo statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed\nbetween the two groups in terms of baseline character-\nistics (Table 1). All patients in the renal failure group had\nreceived dialysis for longer than 3 months (15 haemodia-\nlysis, ﬁve peritoneal dialysis). The average time on\ndialysis was 55.1   31.1 months, the maximum time\nwas 132 months and the minimum time was 17 months.\n \nTable 1 Patient characteristics and study groups\n \n	Groups		\nRenal failure n U 20		Control n U 20	P\n \n\n \nSex, n (%)			\nFemale	10 (50)	13 (65)	0.337\nMale	10 (50)	7 (35)	\nAge (years), mean (SD)	45 (14.9)	44.6 (12.7)	0.919\nWeight (kg), mean (SD)	67.1 (10.4)	73.1 (13.6)	0.129\nHeight (cm), mean (SD)	163.4 (8.7)	165.2 (10.1)	0.549\nBMI (kgm 2), mean (SD)	25.1 (3.8)	27.0 (5.7)	0.230\nCLCR (mlmin 1), mean (SD)	10.3 (4.5)	126.0 (34.6)	<0.001\n \nCLCR, creatinine clearance; SD, standard deviation.\n \nEur J Anaesthesiol 2015; 32:681–686\nCopyright © European Society of Anaesthesiology.

There were\nno signiﬁcant changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation\nafter administration of sugammadex. The values of MAP\nremained stable and similar between the groups through-\nout the observation period.\nDiscussion\nThis prospective comparative clinical trial was designed\nto evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex for\nreversal of profound rocuronium-induced NMB in\npatients with chronic renal failure. The results of this\nstudy show that sugammadex reverses this type of NMB\nsafely and efﬁciently. However, compared with patients\nwith normal renal function, not only was the time\nrequired for this reversal prolonged, but there was also\nsubstantial variability in the recovery times in the\npatients with chronic renal failure. As observed by\nothers,6–8 the time to onset of NMB after rocuronium\nadministration was the same in both groups, and these\ntimes were comparable with the onset of rocuronium in\npatients with normal renal function previously reported\nin the literature.9,10\nStaals et al.11 were the ﬁrst to describe the pharmacoki-\nnetics of sugammadex in patients with renal disease.\nThey used a bioanalytical method for pharmacokinetics\nassessment that did not differentiate between sugamma-\ndex in its free form and in its complex form encapsulating\nrocuronium; hence, all the pharmacokinetics variables\ndescribed in that study represent the total amount of\nsugammadex present.12 Their study11 demonstrated that\nthe pharmacokinetics of sugammadex is signiﬁcantly\naltered by chronic renal failure, as renal excretion is\nthe primary route of elimination of the drug. However,\nas the sugammadex-rocuronium complex is extremely\nstable, reversal of rocuronium NMB by sugammadex\ndepends only on the encapsulation of rocuronium and\nnot on the excretion of the sugammadex-rocuronium\n13 Thus,areductioninsugammadex\ncomplexintheurine.\nclearancedoes notexplainthe differences weobservedin\nthe time to recovery of neuromuscular function after\n \nEur J Anaesthesiol 2015; 32:681–686\nCopyright © European Society of Anaesthesiology.

Although drugs with a small Vd\ncan have their onset time altered signiﬁcantly by vari-\nations intheirdistributionvolume, ithasbeenshown that\nthere is no difference in the sugammadex Vd between\ncontrol and renal failure patients.11\nHowever, it was not\nstated whether patients with kidney disease enrolled in\nthe study underwent routine dialysis prior to surgery.11\nIn\npatients with chronic renal failure, weight gain between\ndialysis sessions represents water retention and this\nwould be expected to increase the volume of distribution\n(Vd) of sugammadex,14,15\nbut dialysis close to surgery\nwouldremovethisexcessﬂuid.Onaccountoftherelative\nurgency of transplant surgery and a need to reduce donor\norgan ischemia time, in our institution, most patients\nundergoing cadaveric kidney transplantation are not\nroutinely dialysed before surgery. Only patients with\nsigniﬁcant associated pathology noted on clinical exami-\nnation (eg pulmonary oedema, hypertension, low oxygen\nsaturation) or seriously abnormal laboratory tests are\nreferred for dialysis before transplantation. Hence, our\nstudy patients with renal failure would demonstrate a\nvery wide range of ﬂuid retention: from those just after\ndialysis (very close to their dry weight), to those some\nsigniﬁcant time after dialysis (with signiﬁcant ﬂuid reten-\ntion). Further studies are necessary to examine the\neffects of such ﬂuid retention on the Vd of sugammadex\nand how this might compromise reversal of NMB after\nsugammadex administration.\nThe efﬁciency of reversal by sugammadex depends on\nthe administration of a dose large enough to neutralise\nthe NMB drug in circulation. It has been demonstrated\nthat the sugammadex dose used in this study (4mgkg 1)\nhas an adequate margin of safety for reversal of profound\nNMB.16\nHowever, the distribution of the drug after its\ninitial administration is inﬂuenced by other factors, such\nas cardiac output, and it has been demonstrated that the\ntime to recovery of neuromuscular function after reversal\nwith sugammadex is inﬂuenced by cardiac output.17\nA\nstatistically signiﬁcant inverse correlation was noted\nbetween the time to recovery of TOF ratio to 0.9 and\ncardiac output.17\nChronic renal failure may also cause\nchanges in the function of various systems, especially the\ncardiovascularsystem.Systemichypertension,haemodia-\nlysis and uremia can induce marked changes in the\nmyocardium compromising both systolic and diastolic\nfunctions.18,19 The severity of these comorbidities\ndepends on several factors that include not only the\nappropriate treatment but also the severity and pro-\ngression of the disease. Cardiac output was not assessed\nin the patients included in this study, but, theoretically,\none could postulate that patients with longer renal dis-\nease duration and longer on dialysis would have a greater\nimpairment of cardiac function. If cardiac dysfunction is a\ncause of delayed recovery of neuromuscular function\nafter reversal by sugammadex in this group, then differ-\nent degrees of cardiac impairment could also explain the\nvariability in recovery times observed in the renal\n20 However, although there was a direct correlation\ngroup.\nbetween time on dialysis and the time to recovery to a\nTOF ratio to 0.7 and to 0.8, there was no such correlation\nfor recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.9. We should expect all\naspects of TOF recovery to be affected similarly, and not\nonly the times to TOF ratios of 0.7 and 0.8. In addition,\nthefactthatthetimetoonsetofrocuroniumwasthesame\nin both groups suggests that myocardial depression is not\nthe main mechanism responsible for the slower recovery\nafter reversal seen in these patients.\nIt is recognised that outliers, especially with small sample\nsizes such as in this study, can not only have a major\nimpact on the Pearson correlation21 coefﬁcient, but also\nthe existence of a correlation does not prove causation.\nOur ﬁndings generate hypotheses, but limitations in our\nmethodology prevent us from drawing further con-\nclusions on the speciﬁc mechanism responsible for the\nlonger neuromuscular recovery time in patients with end-\nstage renal failure undergoing dialysis.\nIn patients with chronic renal disease, the sugammadex–\nrocuronium complex is highly stable, and although it\nremains in the plasma for days until it is cleared, largely\n22 it does not dissociate nor\nthrough high-ﬂow dialysis,\ndoes it result in clinical complications or recurrence of\n23,24 Although the number\nneuromuscular blockade.\nof patients evaluated so far remains small, the safety of\nadministering sugammadex to reverse rocuronium-\ninduced NMB in patients with renal disease has been\ndemonstrated,3,22 and this was partly corroborated by\nthe current study.\nA limitation of the current study was that the obser-\nvation period after sugammadex administration was\nlimited to 2h. After renal transplantation, it would be\nexpected that patients would have their renal function\nfully restored, but such recovery does not occur immedi-\nately, especially when the donor kidney comes from\na recently deceased donor. Thus, a longer period of\nfollow-up until renal function was re-established or,\nfailing that, the ﬁrst postoperative dialysis treatment\nhad taken place, would havebeenmoreappropriate.\nThis is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate that in patients with\nend-stage renal disease, sugammadex, at a dose of\n 1, effectively reverses profound rocuronium-\n4mgkg\ninduced neuromuscular blockade. However, when com-\npared with healthier individuals, the time to recovery of\nmuscle function after reversal is longer and there is a\nmuch greater variability in the recovery times.

Such assess-ments require the aid of appropriate neuromuscular monitoring devices. However, in Korea, routine clinical anaesthesia does not usually involve neuromuscular monitoring, because of lack of understanding of the need for monitoring, or because anaesthesiologists are not yet accustomed to such monitoring, or find it an inconvenience. This is also not uncommon elsewhere in the world [2–5]. In such clinical setting, the efficacy and safety of sugammadex use has not yet been clearly confirmed.\nSugammadex has been demonstrated to shorten the time to reach a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 as well as the extubation time, resulting in improvement of operating room turnover in clinical anaesthesia settings, including neuromuscular monitoring [6, 7]. Therefore, sugamma-dex may be a useful factor for the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol [8]. However, this view-point has not yet been reported in a clinical setting in the absence of neuromuscular monitoring.\nSugammadex may be recommended for the reversal of neuromuscular block in surgery that requires deep blockade to facilitate surgical procedures or that re-quires very short surgical time [6]. From this point of view, laryngeal microsurgery meets the indications for sugammadex use. Therefore, we frequently use this agent for the reversal of neuromuscular block in laryngeal microsurgery, although we do not implement neuromus-cular monitoring, including train-of-four monitoring, for the process.\nWe therefore aimed to investigate whether sugamma-dex shortens anaesthesia time, extubation time, and re-covery time in the postoperative period, and to establish whether it reduces postoperative adverse events, as com-pared with pyridostigmine, one of the reversal agents most commonly used in our hospital. In our hospital, the administration of rocuronium and its reversal agent is not guided by neuromuscular monitoring in patients undergoing laryngeal microsurgery. We hypothesized that sugammadex could shorten anaesthesia and extuba-tion times, as well as the recovery time during the post-operative period, and that it can reduce postoperative\nhaemodynamic complications in patients undergoing la-ryngeal microsurgery, even in the absence of neuromus-cular monitoring\nMethods\nEthical approval for this study was provided by the Korea\nUniversity Guro Hospital Institutional Review Board, Seoul, Republic of Korea on 31 January 2015 (approval\nnumber: KUGH15105-002). The requirement for written\ninformed consent from the patients was waived by the\ninstitutional review board because the design of this\nstudywasaretrospectivestudy.Thetrialwasregistered in the UMIN clinical trials registry (unique trial number:\nUMIN000016602; registration number: R000019266; prin-cipal investigator’s name: Byung Gun Lim; date of registra-tion: 22 February 2015).\nPatient population, study protocol and data collection One hundred and forty patients who underwent elective\nlaryngeal microsurgery with the use of rocuronium as the intraoperative neuromuscular blocking agent, with-out the use of an intraoperative neuromuscular monitor-ing device, at the Korea University Guro Hospital from\nJuly 2013 to February 2015 were retrospectively investi-gated through the electronic medical record system. Pa-tients were all American Society of Anaesthesiologists\n(ASA) physical status I or II and aged 19–75 years. Since the proper sample size calculated from the result of a\npilot study was 70 for each group, among all the patients\nwho met the inclusion criteria since the introduction of\nsugammadex use at our hospital up to the initiation of\nthis study, 70 patients from those to whom sugammadex\nwas administered and 70 patients from those to whom\npyridostigmine was administered were chosen randomly\nusing a random integer generator program. Five patients\nwith unusually long operation time, due to difficulties in\nperforming either endotracheal intubation or the surgery, were excluded, and a total of 135 patients were finally allo-cated to group S (sugammadex group; n =68) or group P\n(pyridostigmine group; n =67) according to the neuro-muscular reversal agent that had been administered. The\ndose of the neuromuscular reversal agent administered at\neach group was as follows: The dose of sugammadex was\n2.3±0.5 mg kg−1 in group S and the dose of pyridostig-mine was 10 mg in all patients in group P. All data,\n \nPark et al. BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:48 	Page 3 of 7\n \n\n \nincluding patients’ characteristics, and primary and sec-ondary outcomes, were collected from the electronic med-ical record system by an investigator unaware of the purpose of the study.\nStudy endpoints\nThe primary outcome was extubation time which was measured as the time interval from the end of surgery to extubation. Secondary outcomes were anaesthesia time, the correlation between anaesthesia time (the time inter-val from intubation to extubation) and extubation time in patients with an anaesthesia time of 30 min or less, the total amount of rocuronium and reversal agents used, the number of patients in whom additional rocuro-nium, beside the initial injection, was required during sur-gery, the interval between the end of surgery and the administration of reversal agents, the interval between the administration of the last dose of rocuronium and the ad-ministration of reversal agents, the time to reach a Ramsay sedation score of 2 and the recovery time in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) (the time to reach a modified Aldrete score of 10 from entering the PACU), and postop-erative adverse events in PACU, including respiratory and haemodynamic complications, postoperative residual weakness, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) or pain (specifically, desaturation [SpO <93%],laryn-\n2\ngospasm [upper airway obstruction], tachypnea or apnea, tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension or hypotension, severe PONV, or pain requiring anti-emetics or analgesics). Tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, and hypotension were considered positive if the values exceeded ± 20 % of the pre-induction vital signs.\nSample size calculation\nThe primary endpoint in this study was extubation time. The sample size calculation was based on the results of extubation time from a pilot study involving 10 cases in each group. In the pilot study, extubation times (mean ± standard deviation) were 6.7 ±3.9 min in group S and 9.5± 6.8 min in group P. Therefore, the effect size of a 2-group study was 0.5. On the assumption that the allo-cation ratio was 1, and with a sample size of 63 for each group, a power of 0.8 at a level of significance of 0.05 would be achieved (calculated by a two-sided Student’s t-test). Considering a 10 % dropout rate, the sample size for final enrolment was 70 in each group.\nsquared test or Fisher’s exact test. Other parametric data, including further demographic data, such as age, height etc., anaesthesia time, extubation time, the total amount of rocuronium injected, the time interval between the end of surgery and the injection of reversal agents, the time interval between the administration of the last dose of rocuronium and the administration of reversal agents, the time to reach a Ramsay sedation score of 2, and the recov-ery time in the PACU were compared using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (normally distributed data) or the Mann– Whitney U-test (non-normally distributed data). The rela-tion between anaesthesia time and extubation time in each group was analyzed with Spearman Rank Order Correl-ation analysis. A P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. We performed Bonferroni correction to reduce the chances of obtaining false-positive results (type I er-rors) when multiple pair wise tests are performed on a single set of data in the statistical analysis of secondary outcomes regarding time intervals which were partly overlapping (the interval between the administration of the last dose of rocuronium and the administration of reversal agents vs. the interval between the end of sur-gery and the administration of reversal agents, and the time to reach a Ramsay sedation score of 2 vs. the re-covery time in the PACU). In the analysis of these out-comes, a P-value <0.025 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 135 patients were evaluated, with 68 patients in-cluded in group S and 67 patients in group P. The demo-graphic and clinical data were not significantly different between the groups (Table 1).

Anaesthesia time was also signifi-cantly (P = 0.043) shorter in group S (30.7± 10.3 min) than in group P (35.8±12.6 min). In the patients with an an-aesthesia time of 30 min or less (32 and 34 patients in groups P and S, respectively), there was a positive correl-ation between anaesthesia time and extubation time in group P (r =0.453; P =0.01), but no significant relation-ship in group S (r =0.271; P =0.12; Fig. 1). The total amount of rocuronium used was higher in group S (0.62\n−1) −1; ±0.11 mg kg than in group P (0.38 ± 0.14 mg kg P ≤ 0.001). Patients in group P needed additional rocur-onium during the surgery in more cases than did those in group S (14 vs. 2, respectively; P =0.003). Among sec-ondary outcomes regarding time intervals, the time to reach a Ramsay sedation score of 2, and the recovery time in the PACU were significantly shorter in group S than in group P (since every patient reached a modified Aldrete score of 10 upon reaching a Ramsay sedation score of 2, the times to reach these two criteria were the same). The interval between the end of surgery and the administration\nof reversal agents, and the interval between the adminis-tration of the last dose of rocuronium and the administra-tion of reversal agents were comparable between the groups (Table 2).\nPostoperative adverse events in the PACU were compar-able between the groups, except for tachycardia events (Table 3). The incidence of tachycardia was significantly (P ≤ 0.001) lower in group S (8.0 %) than in group P (17.3 %). There was one case with PONV who required rescue antiemetics in group S and none in group P; this was not statistically significant. The requirement for post-operative analgesics was similar between the two groups (five cases in group S, four cases in group P). There was no desaturation (SpO <93 %) event in group S, but there\n2\nwas one such case in group P; this case did not fully re-cover until 28 min after the initial rocuronium injection of 0.3 mg kg−1,\nwhich was 10 min after the injection of pyri-dostigmine (10 mg) in the operating room. The patient was moved to the PACU, intubated, and showed an SpO2 <95 % even with a 6 L min−1 of O2 supply connected to\n \nFig. 1 The correlation between anaesthesia time and extubation time. In patients with an anaesthesia time of 30 min or less (32 and 34 patients\nin groups P and S, respectively), there was a significant positive correlation between anaesthesia time and extubation time in group P (r = 0.453;\nP =0.01), but no significant correlation was seen in group S (r = 0.271; P = 0.12).

There was no laryngos-pasm or apnea event in either group.\nDiscussion\nSince its introduction, sugammadex showed marked effi-cacy and safety, ringing in a new era of patient safety in anaesthesiology [7]. However, since its dosing regimen ne-cessitates the use of neuromuscular monitoring, the use of this agent may be limited in certain situations, particularly where such monitoring devices are not routinely used. Several surveys have shown that this is not uncommon, worldwide [2–5]. Hence, we here performed a retrospect-ive study on the efficacy and safety of using sugammadex in the absence of guidance provided by neuromuscular monitoring. We considered that this study could show whether sugammadex reduces anaesthesia and extubation Table 3 Postoperative adverse events in PACU\nVariables Group S Group P P-value\n(n =68) (n =67) PONV required to use rescue antiemetics (n) 1 None 0.994 Hypertension events (%) 3.0 2.9 0.977 Hypotension events (%) 4.1 6.4 0.17 Tachycardia events (%) 8.0* 17.3 ≤0.001 Bradycardia events (%) 7.8 10.7 0.156 Incomplete reversal case with hypoxia (n) None 1 0.994 The patient data are presented as number of patients (n) or incidence of\nhaemodynamic events (%).

The effect of sugammadex in shortening anaesthesia time, extubation time, and re-covery time has been clearly demonstrated by many previous studies performed around the globe in settings using appropriate neuromuscular monitoring. The re-sult of the present study further showed that the effi-cacy of sugammadex remains firm, even in the absence of proper neuromuscular monitoring [9–11].\nSugammadex not only enabled shorter extubation time even with larger dose of rocuronium but also, though not given at the dose guided by proper neuromuscular moni-toring, reversed the neuromuscular block within relatively constant time in our study. In group P, the extubation time was longer and the variation in this time was larger. There was a positive correlation between anaesthesia time and extubation time in group P, but not in group S, which indicated that extubation time in group P functioned as a key component influencing the anaesthesia time, whereas the relatively constant extubation time in group S was not a main determinant of anaesthesia time, even in the ab-sence of neuromuscular monitoring.\nThe shortened anaesthesia time, extubation time, and recovery time in group S may allow faster operating room turnover, and this can allow better patient progno-sis in terms of overall safety and recovery. ERAS has re-cently gained increasing attention. Enhanced recovery protocols for perioperative care have been proven to re-duce complications after surgery, improve overall out-comes, and shorten the length of hospital stay, thus saving on resources [12]. Thus, guidelines for specific fields are being formulated and are being published throughout the world [13–16]. According to the ERAS protocol developed by the ERAS society, using short-acting anesthetic agents is one of the elements compris-ing the intraoperative component of the protocol [17]. Due to its ability to reverse rocuronium-induced neuro-muscular blockade quickly, sugammadex combined with rocuronium can work as a short-acting agent, even cap-able of substituting for succinylcholine [18, 19]. Hence, sugammadex combined with rocuronium can reduce an-aesthesia time, recovery time, and length of hospital stay, making it recommendable as a short-acting anesthetic agent in the ERAS protocol [20, 21]. Based on the re-sults of the present study, we strongly recommend use of sugammadex combined with rocuronium even in a clinical anaesthesia setting without neuromuscular mon-itoring as a new element in the ERAS protocol.\n \nPark et al. BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:48 	Page 6 of 7\n \n\n \nAs for the adverse events, although not statistically significant, there was one case of incomplete reversal in group P, which can cause detrimental complications, whereas no such case was found in group S [22, 23]. As is known from several previous studies and surveys, anaes-thesiologists in our hospital tend also to use larger doses of rocuronium to achieve a theoretical deeper blockade when sugammadex is planned for use at the end of sur-gery; although obtaining a deeper block in group S was not proven by neuromuscular monitoring, this trend is clearly reflected in our study, as the total amount of rocur-onium used in group S was significantly larger than that used in group P [24]. This trend for obtaining a theoretical deeper block, associated with sugammadex in group S, highlights another benefit of sugammadex, in that there were only two cases that needed additional rocuronium during the surgery in group S, whereas group P required this in 14 cases. It can be assumed that additional rocuro-nium was needed because of incomplete or insufficient neuromuscular block, in order to achieve optimal surgical conditions, resulting in the possibility of elongated anaes-thesia time, a shorter time between the last injection of rocuronium and the injection of the reversal agent, and a consequently higher risk of incomplete reversal of neuro-muscular block or recurarization [8, 25]. Postoperative haemodynamic values were found to be better in group S, and the incidence of tachycardia was less. Glycopyrrolate injected along with pyridostigmine in order to block its cholinergic adverse effects may explain the significantly higher incidence of tachycardia in group P [26].\nThe limitation of this study is that it was a retrospect-ive study. We plan a randomized controlled trial on this subject, to further assess its implications for the ERAS protocol and the possible use of sugammadex in com-bination with rocuronium in the ERAS protocol, in the near future.\nConclusions\nSugammadex could shorten anaesthesia and extubation times, as well as the recovery time in the PACU, and re-duce postoperative haemodynamic adverse events in a clinical setting in the absence of neuromuscular monitor-ing. This may enhance the patients’ recovery in the operat-ing room and PACU while improving the postoperative condition of patients and may enhance the ERAS protocol.

We also exam-\nined whether the toF level, type of NMBD \nand reversal agent used, and respiratory events \nin the PacU are associated to an increased in-\ncidence of pneumonia and atelectasis during \nhospital admission.\nMaterials and methods\na prospective observational study of co-\nhorts was designed and approved by the clini-\ncal research ethics committee of our hospi-\ntal (code 06/2014, 29-05-2014). the patients \nsigned the informed consent form for inclusion \nin the study.\nWe included patients admitted to the PacU \nor other proprietary information of the Publisher. on an elective basis (no-emergency basis), with \nspontaneous ventilation. Patients underwent \nsurgery under general anesthesia (intravenous \ninduction with propofol and maintenance with \nsevofurane, bispectral index within 40-60) \nand by volume-controlled ventilation and had \nreceived cis-atracurium (0.12 mg/kg) or ro-\ncuronium (0.6 mg/kg) as NMBD during the \nintervention for orotracheal intubation. the choice of the NMBD and the identifcation of the need for NMB reversal were left to the anesthesiologist, who ignored the inclusion of the patient in the study. Neostigmine 0.03-0.05 mg/kg or sugammadex 2-4 mg/kg were used as reversal agents.\nPatients were extubated and moved to the PacU, with a Hudson oxygen mask (6 l/min) upon arrival in the Unit in all cases.\nexclusion criteria were as follows: failure to obtain consent, patients under 18 years of age, patients with an asa physical status score of iV-V, individuals with known neuromuscular disease, and surgery involving intraoperative hypothermia.\nFour groups were established according to the NMBD and reversal agent used: group 1, cisatracurium; group 2, cisatracurium-neostig-mine (0.03-0.05 mg/kg); group 3, rocuronium; and group 4, rocuronium-sugammadex (2-4 mg/kg, according to toF).\nPORC, defned as TOFr <0.9, was quanti-fed upon admission to the PACU, evaluating the toF in the adductor of the thumb using a toF-Watch sX device (MsD, oss, the Neth-erlands). the nerve was stimulated with a toF (4 stimuli in 2 s at a frequency of 2 Hz, each with a duration of 0.2 ms). current amplitude was 40 ma.1, 6, 7 three consecutive measure-ments spaced 60 s apart were obtained, with registry of the greatest value. if  toFr <0.9, a reversal agent was administered according to the group. residual neuromuscular block was re-evaluated after 5, 10 and 15 minutes if  toFr <0.9.\nWe collected information referred to the pa-tients’ age, sex, Body Mass index (BMi) and comorbidities. the type of anesthesia was also recorded, along with the surgical procedure, surgery time, monitoring of neuromuscular block, type of NMBD, the time period from last dose administration to the end of the operation, and the use and type of reversal agent, at the end of the operation and in the PacU.\nthe duration of stay in the PacU was documented, together with the appearance of critical respiratory events (CREs), defned as minor (upper airway obstruction requiring in-\n \n\n \n736	MiNerVa aNestesiologica 	July 2016\n \n© \n              COPYRIGHT 2016 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA \n \nnot permitted.

Murphy 15 in turn \nrecorded Porc in 30% of the cases.\narbous et al.16 observed a signifcant de-\ncrease in Porc when monitoring muscle re-\nlaxation in the operating room and using re-\nversal agents.\nin contrast, in the study published by cammu \net al.,17 although 15% of the patients that recov-\nered spontaneously from neuromuscular block \nand 15% of those who underwent reversal with \nneostigmine presented Porc (versus only 2% \nof those who were administered sugammadex), \nno statistically signifcant relationship was ob-\nserved between the absence of monitoring or \nreversal before extubation and Porc.\nin our study, 27.9% of the patients presented \nPorc upon admission to the PacU. the intra-\noperative monitoring rate was similar in all of \nthe groups (around 30%). However, the distribu-\ntion of Porc among the different groups was \nnot homogeneous, being greater in those patients \nthat received cisatracurium and rocuronium \nwithout reversal. in this regard, in the absence of \nblock reversal up to 34.6% and 34% of the pa-\ntients administered cisatracurium and rocuroni-\nor other proprietary information of the Publisher. um developed Porc, respectively. in contrast, \n28.6% of the patients who received a reversal \nagent (neostigmine) in the cisatracurium group \nshowed Porc, versus only 1.1% of the patients \nsubjected to muscle relaxation with rocuronium \nand reversal with sugammadex. these results \nalso indicate that, although neostigmine reduces \nPorc, it is considerably less effective than su-\ngammadex – in part because of the importance of the timing of neostigmine administration, with limited effcacy in deep block.18 this does not happen with sugammadex, which allows rapid recovery after deep block with rocuronium,19, 20 independently of the time of the end of surgery.\nthe residual effects of muscle relaxants have well-known clinical implications.10, 11 in this regard, Porc increases the incidence of adverse respiratory events in the postoperative period. arbous et al. reported that monitoring and the use of reversal agents reduce postop-erative morbidity and mortality.16\nin two independent studies, Berg et al.21 and Bessinger et al.22 related Porc to the appear-ance of postoperative respiratory complica-tions, particularly when long half-life muscle relaxants are used.\nMurphy et al.15 monitored patients during the frst 15 minutes in the PACU and found the incidence of Porc to be higher in patients with critical respiratory events – establishing a major respiratory complications index of 0.8% in patients with Porc. Norton et al.23 reported a 26% incidence of minor cres, and likewise established an association between high-risk surgery and an increased incidence of Porc.\nin contrast, cammu 17 found no differenc-es in the PacU regarding the respiratory and airway variables in patients with or without Porc.\nin our study the global incidence of minor respiratory episodes was 14.5% appearing more frequently in the absence of neuromus-cular block reversal, whilst if the NMB was reversed, this incidence decreased with neo-stigmine and in a more pronounced way in patients reversed with sugammadex. the inci-dence was found to be 27.5% and 10.5% with cisatracurium and rocuronium, respectively, in the absence of neuromuscular block rever-sal. in contrast, in the presence of reversal with neostigmine and sugammadex, the inci-dence was 17.4% and 2.3%, respectively. in relation to major respiratory complications, our observed incidence of 7.5% is consistent with the data published by ledowsky et al.24 likewise, the patients with Porc had a high-er percentage of such complications.\n \n\n \n740	MiNerVa aNestesiologica 	July 2016\n \n© \n              COPYRIGHT 2016 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA \n \nnot permitted.

Core temperature can be reduced by 1.6 degrees Celsius (°C) within the first hour and by 2.8°C during 3 hours in a 22°C air-conditioned environment [2]. Perioperative hypothermia has been associated with adverse patient outcomes, the most significant of which is an increased rate of myocardial ischemia, coagulopathies, postoperative shivering and wound infection [3-5]. The duration of vecuronium blockade is prolonged for twice the amount of time * Correspondence: kimks@hanyang.ac.kr\n1Department\nof Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Hanyang University\nHospital, #17 Haengdang dong, Sungdong gu, Seoul 133-792, Korea Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nwhen the core temperature is decreased to 34.5°C [6]. So it is important to confirm the effect of core\ntemperature to the reversal of rocuronium-induced\nneuromuscular block.\nγ\nSugammadex, a modified -cyclodextrin that encapsulates\nsteroidal neuromuscular block (NMB) agents (such as\nrocuronium and vecuronium) in a highly selective fashion, has been shown to be reliable and complete, and can\nrapidly reverse moderate or deep NMB [7]. A deep NMB\n–\nstate [post-tetanic count (PTC) 1 2] was maintained\nuntil the closure or removal of the last device during\nlaparoscopic surgery, and which can improve surgical\nconditions compared with moderate NMB [8]. The\nrapid and reliable antagonistic action of competitive NMB\nagents after surgery can enhance the safety and efficacy of the patients [9]. However, the reversal effect of sugammadex has not been investigated in mild hypothermia.\n \n© 2015 Lee et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

The current study was registered at clinical trials.gov under the identification number NCT01965067 (Merck protocol no. MK8616-099).\nSixty patients of both sexes, ASA physical status I - II,\n–\naged between 21 64 years, that were undergoing elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either the hypothermia group (n=30) (mild hypothermia with core temperatures between 34.5°C and 35°C) or the control group (n=30) (normal thermal condition with core temperatures between 36.5°C and 37°C) using a computer-generated program. Patients were excluded if they were expected to have a difficult airway, suffered from neuromuscular, hepatic or renal diseases and undertaken the surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass; patients that were using any medication that might interact with muscle relaxants were also excluded in addition to pregnant women, and patients whose body mass index was<18.5 kg/m2 2\nor > 25 kg/m . Study procedures\nThe patients were monitored with electrocardiography, non-invasive arterial pressure measurement, and pulse oximetry. Hypnotic depth was evaluated using a bispectral index (BIS) XP monitor (Model A 2000, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA).

Core body temperature was continuously observed by a thermocouple placed in the distal esophagus (DeRoyal®, DeRoyal Industries Inc., Powell, TN, USA). Core temperature was manipulated in core temperature ranges: 36.5°C and 37°C in the control group using forced-air warming (Bair Hugger Model 505, Arizant Healthcare, Eden Prairie, MN, USA), and 34.5°C and 35°C in the hypothermia group in a 22°C environment by surface cooling and the air conditioner fan. The skin temperature of the monitored arm was maintained at greater than 32°C with fixed temperature sensor at the distal end of the forearm in both groups.\nNeuromuscular monitoring was performed with accelero-myography using the TOF-Watch SX® (Merck Sharp &\nDohme Corp., Glostrup, Denmark) at the adductor pollicis.\nTwo pediatric electrodes (CleartrodeTM,ConMed®,Utica, NY, USA) were placed over the ulnar nerve near the wrist. A 5-s 50-Hz tetanic stimulus was applied using the\nautomated CAL2 mode to calibrate the TOF-Watch\nSX®, and then a supramaximal current was obtained\nafter the initial single twitch calibration [10]. A bolus dose of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was injected and tracheal\nintubation was performed after a maximum NMB was\nachieved. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide\nlevel between 30 and 35 mmHg. The ulnar nerve at the wrist was stimulated supramaximally with a TOF\nmode every 15 seconds (s). The PTC stimulation was\ninitially performed 10 minutes (min) after obtaining\ncomplete NMB, and repeated manually every 6 min to monitor deep NMB throughout the study [11].\n− −\n– μ 1 1) was continuously\nRocuronium (7 10 g.kg .min\n–\ninfusedtoadjusttoPTC1 2 from 30 min after the\ninitial dose of rocuronium [12]. After the surgical dressing,\n–\nPTC 1 2 was confirmed on the TOF-Watch SX® reading, and then sugammadex 4 mg/kg was injected.\nThe primary objective was to evaluate recovery\ntime and response to sugammadex after a prolonged\nrocuronium-induced deep NMB during mild hypothermia\nbetween 34.5°C and 35°C. Full recovery from the NMB was conducted during the administration of sevoflurane and remifentanil. The time to recovery of a train-of-four\n(TOF) ratio of 0.9 was evaluated and normalized by the\nbaseline TOF ratio to improve the accuracy of NMB data\n[13]. Blood pressure, heart rate and BIS were measured at\npre-reversal, post-reversal, recovery and post-anesthetic\nvisits. The incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade, post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and adverse\nevents during mild hypothermia and the normal\nthermal condition were estimated for up to 7 days\nafter administration of sugammadex by the assessor\nblinded to the study groups. Extubation was carried out after consciousness and regular respiration were\nconfirmed. All neuromuscular results were stored in the computer and monitored until the end of the study.\nRisk factors for PONV were also assessed at baseline and\nused to assess the likelihood that any occurrences of\nPONV were associated with study therapy [14].\nStatistical analysis\nFor calculations, we used the statistical software package\nSPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The\nsample size was calculated from the previous results of the averaged recovery time [mean (SD): 102 (42) seconds (s)] from deep rocuronium-induced NMB to a TOF ratio of 0.9 after sugammadex 4 mg/kg [15]. We considered\n \nLee et al.

A sample size of 26 patients per group were needed for a power of 80% at a significance level of 5% (two-sided). We enrolled 30 patients per group to account for a 10% discontinuation rate. The results were presented as the mean values (SD or range). Categorical data was compared between groups using chi-squared analysis. Between-group comparisons were made using\nt\nunpaired -tests. A repeated measures ANOVA was used\np for the changes of blood pressure and heart rate. A -value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results\nFlow diagram of study participants in each group is shown in Figure 1. Sixty patients were enrolled in this study, and neuromuscular monitoring was successfully conducted. The two groups were similar in their demographic profile, anesthetic time, BIS, end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane, total dose of rocuronium, type of surgery, location of abdominal surgery, and core temperature(Table1).Thetargetcoretemperaturein either hypothermia patients [34.8 (0.1)°C] or normothermia patients [36.7 (0.1)°C] was well maintained at the injection of sugammadex. In our study, the core temperature was steadily dropped during the course of the surgery in the hypothermia patients, and no rapid changes were observed.\nThe mean recovery time to TOF ratio of 0.9 after sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg was 171.1 (62.1) s in the hypothermia group compared with 124.9 (59.2) s in\np\nthe normothermia group ( =0.005) (Table 2). For most patients (83%; 25/30 patients) in the normothermia group, the recovery time to the TOF ratio of 0.9 was less than 180 s. By comparison, in the hypothermia group, 60% of patients (18/30 patients) had recovered to a TOF ratio of 0.9 within 180 s.\nThemeanarterialpressureduringthe180speriod following administration of sugammadex was not changed,\nbut the heart rate during the same period decreased significantly after sugammadex was administered in\np\nboth groups ( <0.001) (Figure 2). Shivering was observed in four patients in the hypothermia group, which could be easily controlled by adjusting and administering meperidine 25 mg intravenously. PONV and any other adverse effects following administration of sugammadex were not reported in either group.\nDiscussion\nOur study confirmed that the recovery time to the TOF ratio of 0.9 after sugammadex administration in deep NMB was prolonged by 46 s during mild hypothermia (171.1 s) compared with the normal thermal condition (124.9 s).\nRecovery at doses of sugammadex 4 mg/kg in a deep\n–\nblock at PTC 1 2 occurred within 120 s in younger adults [16]. Similar recovery time (162 s) after sugammadex\n–\nat PTC 1 2 was reported [17].

However, sugammadex reversed the state within 171.1 (62.1) s from a rocuronium-induced deep NMB in hypothermia patients. The mechanism by which hypothermia prolongs the reversal from deep NMB with sugammadex remains controversial. The duration of action and rocuronium recovery were prolonged by moderate hypothermia (nasopharyngeal temperature: 30.4°C) due to reduced plasma clearance [18]. The adequate reversal of vecuronium block by neostigmine can be delayed during hypothermia (34.5°C) (more than 30 min) due to the prolonged duration of vecuronium and a decreased efficacy of neostigmine [6]. However, we found that, even in hypothermia, reversal with sugammadex was complete although hypothermia patients required additional 46 s to recover compared with the normothermia patients.\nStudies have reported that cardiac output declined markedly in response to hypothermia [19,20]. The onset of action of sugammadex may be affected by the cardiac output and muscle blood flow. The reduction of cardiac output is linearly associated with hypothermia, which is associated with decreased regional blood flow distribution compared with that of normothermia [19]. A lower regional blood flow implies that the delivery of the drug\nis reduced, which leads to a slower transfer rate of\nsugammadex and a slower reduction of free (unbound)\nrocuronium in the plasma. Although we could not measure the the pharmacokinetics of rocuronium and sugammadex, we suspect that this effect may reduce the speed of the\nrecovery from NMB by sugammadex during hypothermia.\nGood and optimal surgical conditions (99%) during\ndeep NMB (good 32% and optimal 67%) were achieved\nwith a higher frequency than during moderate NMB\n(82%) (good 48% and optimal 34%) in retroperitoneal\n–\nlaparoscopies [8]. In the present study, a PTC 1 2indeep NMB is maintained during anesthesia with continuous\ninfusion of rocuronium, which can achieve total dia-phragmatic paralysis in response to tracheal suction\n[21]. We suspect that the ability to provide deep\nNMB throughout the procedure may enable improved\nsurgical access and an enhanced visual field.\nIn adults, the infusion rate of rocuronium to maintain\n− − 10% of first twitch of TOF was 0.3 - 0.4 mg.kg 1 h 1\nunder inhalational anesthesia [22].

Among these agents; neostigmine is the most potent and selective one.3 However, anti-cholinesterases have unfavourable drawbacks (hypersalivation, bradycardia, bronchoconstric-tion, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps) that can be overcome through co-administration of antimuscarinic agents (atropine or glycopyrro-late). Meanwhile, antimuscarinics also have unfavourable side effects like dry mouth, tachy-cardia, and blurred vision.4,5 Moreover, anti-cholinesterases are not capable of reversing deeper levels of NMB.5,6\nToday, sugammadex is an alternative to the decurarisation procedure which has the ability to reverse NMB effectively and independently of its depth. PORC and the muscarinic side effects are not expected when using sugammadex which has been assigned to be selective for rocuronium and vecuronium. Sugammadex is a modiﬁed gammacyclodextrin formulated to be a reversal agent for steroidal neuromuscular blocking drugs. It develops a tight one-to-one complex with rocuronium or vecuronium, encapsulating the drug in plasma and thereby reducing its con-centration at the neuromuscular junction with subsequent rapid reversal of the blockade.7–11 Multiple trials have reported safety and superior-ity of sugammadex over neostigmine for reversal of NMB in adults.7–11 However, few studies have concerned sugammadex use in paediatric patients.12\nThe aim of this work was to compare between sugammadex and neostigmine concerning the recovery time from NMB in paediatric patients undergoing lower abdominal surgeries. We hypothesised that sugammadex may have shorter recovery time than neostigmine.\nMethods\nSixty healthy American Society of Anaesthesiol-ogists (ASA) class I or II paediatric patients aged 2–10 years scheduled for lower abdominal surgeries were enrolled in this study (Fig. 1). A\nwritten informed consent was obtained from the person legally responsible for the child and institutional review board approval of Minou-ﬁya Faculty of Medicine was obtained (MFM-IRB 00013414). The current trial was registered with Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR201511001296403) before enrollment of the participants. Exclusion criteria included body mass index more than 40 kg/m,2 kidney or liver disease, history of neuromuscular disease or malignant hyperthermia, mental retardation and hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups (30 patients each) to receive sugam-madex (Group S) or neostigmine (Group N) as a reversal drug for rocuronium at the end of surgery.\nRandomisation was performed through using a random number table generated by Microsoft Excel. An independent statistician was assigned to perform central randomisation to ensure proper concealment of the study management from patients, and investigators until the release of the ﬁnal statistical results. The syringes con-taining the NMB reversal were prepared and coded by two independent anaesthesiologists not involved in patient care or data collection and handled them to the clinical staff. The anaesthesiologist in charge of train of four (TOF) monitoring and investigators responsible for data collection were blinded to the adminis-tration of NMB reversal.\nAll patients were monitored by continuous electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry, capnography, and non-invasive blood pressure. The depth of anaesthesia was monitored using the bispectral index score (BIS) through stan-dard electrodes (BIS-Sensor, Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) on the forehead and was maintained between 45–55. NMB was monitored at the wrist using the TOF. TOF equipment working with the nerve-muscle acceleromyometry principle (TOF-Watch, Orga-non Technica, Eppelheim,Germany) was placed on the ulnar nerve of all patients to trigger stim-ulation of the adductor pollicis muscle. The peripheral heat sensor was placed onto the ven-tral side of the hand. The acceleromyographic transducer was tightly positioned on the palmar aspect of the top of the thumb and in a perpen-dicular plane to the movement of the thumb.

AMMAR ET AL.\n \n5-s, 50-Hz tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve was used for stabilisation after induction of anaesthesia. Then, the ﬁngers were ﬁxated after 1 min and TOF stimulation was performed and continued for 2–3 min and calibration was per-formed. Supramaximal stimulation was used (current< 60 mA) with square wave pulses duration of 0.2 ms that were delivered as TOF pulses of 2 Hz at intervals of 15 s. The data were recorded on a laptop computer by means of the TOF-Watch  SX Monitoring Program (TOFMON 1.2; NV Organon, Dublin, Ireland).\nAfter adequate pre-oxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1 lg/kg IV, followed by propofol 1.5–2.5 mg/kg until BIS reached the range of 45–55. Then calibration and stabilisation of neuromuscular monitoring were performed in a standardised manner for each patient followed by rocuronium administration in a dose of 0.6 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation when twitch suppression was 100%. Maintenance of anaesthesia was performed with minimum alveo-lar concentration (MAC) of 1.2–2% isoﬂurane in air/oxygen mixture (1 : 1). The TOF was assessed every 10 min. Rocuronium (0.1 mg/kg) was administered when TOF count becomes ≥ 1. The maintenance ﬂuid ‘10% dextrose with 0.22% Na Cl’ was administered at the rate of 4 ml/kg/h and normothermia was maintained by warming air blankets (Bair Hugger; Arizant Healthcare Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA) throughout surgery.\nParacetamol in a dose of 15 mg/kg IV was given at the end of surgery for both groups.\nAt the end of surgery, patients were switched to 100% O under TOF monitoring and the fol-\n2\nlowing were performed:\nGroup S (n = 30): Post-tetanic count (PTC)\nstimulation was carried out every 5 min till\nreaching a PTC of 1 to 2; thereafter, patient\nreceived initial dose of sugammadex 4 mg/kg.\nAnother dose of sugammadex (4 mg/kg) was\ngiven if TOF ratio did not reach 0.9 within\n10 min.\nGroup N (n = 30): 0.35 mg/kg neostigmine\nplus 0.02 mg/kg atropine were given only\nwhen T2 reappeared on TOF. Another dose of\nneostigmine and atropine was given if TOF\nratio did not reach 0.9 within 10 min.\nIsoﬂurane administration was switched off in both groups when TOF ratio reached 0.9.\nExtubation in both groups was performed when TOF ratio reached 0.95. After extubation, the patient was transferred to post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and the recovery score was evalu-ated every 5 min using the modiﬁed Aldrete score,13 until patient achieved the full discharge criteria.\nPrimary outcome was the recovery time (time from starting of sugammadex or neostigmine till reaching TOF ratio> 0.9).\nSecondary outcomes included the following number of patients who needed another dose of sugammadex or neostigmine to reach TOF ratio> 0.9, extubation time (time from stoppage of anaesthetic inhalation until the patient ful-ﬁlled global and respiratory criteria for safe extubation), time from reversing agent injection to PACU arrival, PACU discharge time (time from PACU admission till modiﬁed Aldrete scale ≥ 9) and any PORC or adverse events. Post-operative adverse events included post-operative nausea and or vomiting (PONV), shiv-ering, bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beat/min), tachycardia (heart rate> 130 beat/min), dry mouth, and respiratory depression (respiratory rate< 8 or oxygen saturation< 90%). Further-more, body core temperature was recorded throughout surgery and for 1 h post-operatively. Statistical analysis\nContinuous variables are presented as mean   standard deviation and qualitative data as numbers. Statistical analyses were carried out using Statistica for Windows version 10.0 soft-ware (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Before the study, a power analysis was carried out to deter-mine the necessary number of patients in each group based on recovery time from NMB in pae-diatric patients. With a two-sided type I error of 5% and study power at 80%, a mean sample size of 30 patients in each group was found enough to detect a difference of 50% or more in the recovery time between both groups based on a previous pilot study in our institution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify normal distribution of data. Unpaired t test was used to compare parametric data between both groups whereas Mann-whitney U test was used to compare non-parametric variables.

Recovery and extubation times were signiﬁcantly shorter in Group S and signif-icantly more patients in Group N who needed another reversal dose. A single dose of sugam-madex (4 mg/kg) was not enough in one patient in Group S to produce a TOF ratio of 0.9 in 10 min as the TOF ratio was 0.8 before an addi-tional dose of sugammadex was given to this patient (Table 2).\nTime from reversing agent injection to PACU arrival was signiﬁcantly shorter in Group S whereas PACU discharge time showed no sig-niﬁcant difference in between both groups.

The recovery time was statistically shorter in the sugam-madex group (1.4 1.2 min) than those\n \nin neostigmine group (25.2   6.5 min) without PORC or any major adverse events in any patient throughout the study period.\nPlaud and colleagues,14 compared the safety and efﬁciency of sugammadex in infants, chil-dren, adolescents and adults. The patients were given rocuronium in a dose of 0.6 mg/kg and randomised to receive sugammadex (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg/kg) or placebo at reappearance of T2 of TOF. The recovery time after 2.0 mg/kg sugammadex was 0.6, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.2 min respectively. Sugammadex plasma concentration was similar for all age groups across the dose range. The authors concluded that recovery time was comparable with no PORC or other adverse effects in all age groups.\nAnother study conﬁrmed that the pharmacoki-netics of sugammadex are comparable in paedi-atrics and adults.15\nIt should be emphasised that the dose of neuro-muscular blockers in paediatrics should be larger than that in adults as children have a larger extra-cellular space volume with consequent lower plasma levels of neuromuscular blockers.16 Therefore, higher doses of neuromuscular block-ers are needed to achieve the same level of NMB in children as in adults. Furthermore, the motor end plate in paediatrics is relatively not fully mature and receptors have a lower afﬁnity for the neuromuscular blockers.17 Moreover, the dia-phragm in paediatrics has much more type I ﬁb-rins than in adults which makes it more sensitive to NMB.18 Consequently, all of these factors make paediatric patients more susceptible to the risk of PORC, respiratory depression and apnea. Therefore, every effort should be made to assure proper and complete reversal of NMB. Mean-while, subjective evaluation of NMB recovery in the form of adequate spontaneous breathing and muscle power is not absolutely safe; therefore, objective detection of any PORC is highly\nwarranted to exclude any subclinical PORC before progressing to catastrophic conse-quences.19 Moreover, sugammadex reversal should be highly warranted and indicated in patients with cardiovascular or respiratory dis-eases who can not tolerate the tachycardia and muscarinic side effects of atropine and neostig-mine as sugammadex lacks these undesirable effects.\nBellod et al.,20 reported a case of delayed recurarisation after sugammadex reversal. The authors explained that event through either cap-turing or displacement reaction. In capturing reaction, a fraction of sugammadex encapsulates a high afﬁnity molecule with a resulting drop in the action of the remaining drug. In displace-ment reaction, the administration of another drug with a high-binding afﬁnity for sugam-madex might displace a portion of the encapsu-lated rocuronium from its complex with sugammadex with consequent recurarisation.\nAlso, Le Corre et al.,21 reported a case of PORC in an obese patient. Shortly after extuba-tion, the patient developed respiratory failure requiring reintubation and an additional dose of sugammadex. This happened despite initial reversal of NMB with an appropriate dose of sugammadex (200 mg) given at reappearance of T2 of TOF.\nSpontaneous recovery from rocuronium-induced NMB without any antagonists is practically feasible but needs a much longer time when compared with sugammadex rever-sal.22\nAdditionally, it should be kept in mind that sugammadex only reverses steroidal muscle relaxants (rocuronium > vecuronium > pancuro-nium) whereas neostigmine remains the only available reversal agent for atracurium, cisatra-curium or mivacurium. Moreover, it should be highlighted that the afﬁnity of sugammadex to pancuronium is extremely low.6\nThe combination of glycopyrrolate and neostigmine would probably have less pro-nounced muscarinic adverse effects than combi-nation of atropine and neostigmine; however, still less favourable than sugammadex. There-fore, the current ﬁnding would be more relevant if sugammadex was compared with the best possible alternative and that fact can be consid-ered a limitation to the present study.\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 374–380 378 ª 2017 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\n \nTHE COMPARISON OF SUGAMMADEX AND NEOSTIGMINE\n \nIn conclusion, sugammadex administration for reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB in paedi-atrics resulted in faster recovery and extubation times and lower incidence of PONV, tachycardia and dry mouth when compared with the tradi-tional reversal by neostigmine and atropine. These advantages may be of great importance in paediatric patients undergoing outpatient surgi-cal procedures to assure safe and rapid post-operative recovery.\nAcknowledgements\nWe pay great gratitude to operating room and paediatric PACU staff in Minouﬁya University Hospital for their support in conducting the study procedures.

Introduction\nIn pediatric anesthesia, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA)arefrequentlyusedtofacilitatetrachealintubation [1],positivepressureventilation,andoptimalsurgicaloperat-ingconditions[2].Recently,somepublicationsinadults[ –6]\n3\nhave found that deep neuromuscular blockade signifcantly improves intra-abdominal space and surgical working con-ditions throughout laparoscopic procedures. However, the use of NMBA exposes the patient to the well-described risk of residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) [7]. In adults, many studies have estimated the risk of RNMB to range anywhere from 3.5% to 83% [8]. In children, however, the availabledataisextremelysparse[2]withjustonepublication investigating the matter within the last decade [9]. Te risks associated with RNMB are commonly underestimated by anesthesiologists, even though the pathophysiological\nconsequences of residual paralysis may be severe [8]. Te use of NMBA has been associated with an increased risk for respiratoryadverseeventsinchildrenundergoinganesthesia, particularly in the postoperative period [10], as well as with more direct impairments of lung function [11].\nIt was the aim of this prospective audit, therefore, to identify the rate and severity of RNMB at our tertiary pediatric center.\n2. Methods\nEthicsapprovalwasgrantedforthisprojectfromthePrincess Margaret Hospital Ethics Committee (457 QP) and recog-nized by the Human Research Ethics Ofce of the University of Western Australia (RA/4/1/5966). Written informed con-sent was waived since this audit was classifed as a quality of care audit due to its purely observational character.\n \n2 Anesthesiology Research and Practice\n \nAll children undergoing elective or urgent surgery under general anaesthesia requiring an endotracheal tube and receiving NMBA at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, Western Australia, during the time period from 11/9/2011 to 12/16/2011 were targeted forthisaudit. Exclusions included patients operated on outside normal working hours (Monday to Friday 8a.m. to 6p.m.), emergency procedures, children who were not planned to be extubated in the operating theatre, and infants under 12 months who were too small for the available monitoring electrodes to be attached.\nData recorded included basic demographic information, as well as preexisting medical conditions and preoperative medications,datarelatedtosurgeryandanesthesia(i.e., type of surgery, time of surgery and anesthesia, method of anesthesia,andNMBAused),andadverseeventsrecordedin thepostoperativeacutecareunit(PACU).\nAttheendofthesurgicalprocedureandwhentheattend-ing anesthesiologist deemed it safe to extubate the child, the train-of-four (TOF) ratio was assessed by an independent researcher using acceleromyometry (TOF Watch; Organon Teknika;Durham,NorthCarolina,USA)viaasupramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve. In the interests of patient safety, the results of this assessment were disclosed to the attending anesthesiologist immediately prior to extubation. However, the choice of whether or not to reverse the patient pharmacologically and when to extubate the patient was lef to the attending anesthesiologist.\nAfer tracheal extubation, children were transferred to the PACU, where adverse events (postoperative nausea and vomiting, severe pain, severe coughing, stridor/obstruction, broncho- or laryngospasm, and oxygen desaturation) were recorded by the attending nurses.\n2.1.SampleSizeandStatisticalAnalysis. Tesamplingperiod was not determined by a formal sample size calculation but simply by the desire to capture data over the equivalent of 1 calendar month [12].\nSubsequently, all data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 19 (IBM; Armonk, NY; USA). To compare the incidence of RNMB between diferent groups of patients, the Chi-square test was used. ANOVA was used to compare data between patients with or without TOF ratios of <0.9. � was set at 0.05. Data are displayed as mean (SD).\n3. Results\nDuring the 5-week study period, a total of 94 tracheally intubated children were screened for inclusion in this audit. Ofthose94children,30childrenwereexcludedasnoNMBA was subsequently given in these cases.\nData of 64 children (8.2 (5.9)yrs; 35.1 (22.6)kg) were analyzed.\nPatient characteristics and NMBA details are provided in Table 1.\nTe administration of an additional intraoperative dose of NMBA was given following a request for prolonged neuromuscular paralysis by the surgeon in all cases.\nNeuromuscular monitoring was not routinely used (total �=15(23.4%); TOF �=14 �=1such\n;PTC ),\nTable1:Patientcharacteristics(ASA:AmericanSocietyofAnesthe-siology, NMBA: neuromuscular blocking agent); total � =64.\nI: 34\nASA category (�) II: 20\nIII: 10\nGeneral: 24\nOrthopedic: 7\nUrology: 11\nProcedure (�) ENT: 5\nPlastics: 4\nEye: 2\nOther: 11\nElective: 44\nUrgency (�)\nUrgent: 20\nAtracurium: 41\nRocuronium: 15\nNMBA on induction (�)\nSuccinylcholine: 6\nVecuronium: 1\nAtracurium: 10\nRocuronium: 2 NMBA during maintenance (�)\nVecuronium: 1\nMivacurium: 1 that, in 49 children, the attending anesthesiologist used no neuromuscular monitoring at all.\nReversal was deemed to be required (by attending anes-thesiologist) in 33 (51.6%) children.

Usually, such bolus results in a deep level of neuromuscular block (NMB) followed by spontaneous recovery until a new bolus is adminis-tered. However, as the diaphragm and the abdominal wall muscles are among the most resistant to NMBDs,67these have\n89already\nrecovered 50–75% from the neuromuscular block at a train-of-four- (TOF) count of 1 measured at the adductor pollicis muscle. Even at a TOF count of 0, the patient is able to cough, and the abdomen may feel tight during surgery.10 With establishment of deep NMB defined as a post-tetanic-count (PTC) between 0 and 1, all muscles including the abdominalwallmusclesandthedia-phragm are paralyzed during i.v. or inhalation anaesthesia.11\nIn laparoscopy, a recent systematic review reported that use of deep NMB improved surgical conditions.12 Another recent review came to slightly different conclusions and questioned if deep NMB was better than moderate block13 and this issue has subsequently been debated.14 15 During open prostatectomy, NMB defined as TOF   1 improved surgical conditions compared with no neuro-muscular block.1 However, during upper laparotomy with surgery performed in close proximity to the diaphragm, no previous stud-ies have investigated the effect of deep NMB on surgical conditions compared with standard NMB defined as bolus administration. Accordingly, we aimed at investigating if deep NMB improved sub-jective ratings of surgical conditions during upper laparotomy. We hypothesized that deep NMB with continuous infusion compared with standard NMB by bolus dosing, improved surgical conditions evaluated on a subjective five point rating scale.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThis randomized patient and surgeon blinded study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Copenhagen\n(Protocol No. H-2-2014-048), the Danish Health and Medicines Authority (EudraCT No. 2014-001155-22), the Danish Data Protection Agency (Protocol No. HEH-2014-040) and registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02140593) May 13th 2014 before inclusion of the first patient. The study was carried out at Aarhus University Hospital, Nørrebrogade, Denmark between September 2014 and May 2016 and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)/ Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines16 supervised by an inde-pendent inspector from the GCP unit of Aalborg and Aarhus University Hospitals, Denmark. All patients gave their signed and written consent.\nPatients aged>18yr undergoing elective open upper abdomi-nal surgery [Whipple, gastrectomy, splenectomy, gastric resec-tion, liver resection and laparotomies because of bile obstruction, i.e. hepaticojejunostomy (not cholecystectomy)] were eligible. Exclusion criteria were known allergy to rocuro-nium or sugammadex, neuromuscular disease interfering with neuromuscular monitoring, severe renal disease (S-creatini-ne 0,200mmol L 1,  1 or\n> glomerular filtration rate<30ml min\nhaemodialysis), lactating or pregnant, and an abdominal mesh with a size larger than five times five centimeters.\nPatients were block randomized (in blocks of 4) using a com-puter- generated randomization list with stratification for a BMI below or above 30 and for type of surgery (liver resection or other laparotomy). Patients were assigned to either the DEEP group or to the STANDARD group (Fig. 1).\nNeuromuscular block and interventions\nNeuromuscular block was monitored continuously in both groups by an investigator not involved in the care of the patient. Tracheal intubation was performed two min after administra-\n 1.\ntion of rocuronium 0.6mg kg In group DEEP, after tracheal\n 1) intubation patients received rocuronium infusion (2mg ml with a target level of PTC 0-1. Just before skin incision, 1ml of saline (placebo) was administered. In group STANDARD after tracheal intubation, patients received a saline infusion (placebo)\n 1 of rocuronium was admin-and just before incision, 0.1mg kg\nistered (Fig. 1).\nIn case of indication for rapid-sequence induction, the patient received succinylcholine 1mg kg 1 for tracheal intuba-tion. After tracheal intubation and full recovery from succinyl-\n 1 and the choline, group DEEP received rocuronium 0.6mg kg\nSTANDARD group received 5ml of saline (placebo).\nSurgical conditions were evaluated on a 5-point subjective rating scale (1 extremely poor conditions; 5 optimal conditions, Table 1): after placement of retractors, every 30min (retrospec-tively from the previous assessment till the present) and after closure of the abdominal wall. Applicability of the 5-point rating scale was tested on five patients before inclusion where sur-geons, blinded to whether NMB was applied, practiced the use of the scale two at the time, and disagreements on its use were discussed and reconciled. Additionally, all surgeons received a written instruction of how to use the scale.\nIn case of need of an anaesthetic intervention (from skin incision through abdominal wall closure) as a result of poor sur-gical conditions, the first choice was to increase the depth of anaesthesia with propofol or opioids at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist to ensure sufficient depth of anaesthesia and prevent awareness. If there still remained a need for anaes-thetic intervention, this was achieved in a standardized man-ner. In Group STANDARD, a 10mg bolus of rocuronium was administered if the weight of the patient was between 50–90kg.\n \nDeep neuromuscular block during laparotomy | 437\n \n		Excluded (n=141)\n	Assessed for eligibility (n=269)	\n		Known allergy to rocuronium\nCONSORT flow diagram		\n		or sugammadex (n=1)\n		Neuromuscular disease (n=2)\n	Randomized (n=128)	Severe renal disease (n=2)\n		Abdominal mesh with size\n		larger than 5*5 cm (n=6)\nAllocated to deep NMB (	Allocated to standard NMB (n=63)	\n		No informed consent (n=42)\nReceived allocation (n	Received allocation (n=63)	\n		Did not speak Danish (n=6)\n		Logistic reasons (n=82)\nAnaesthesia induction	Anaesthesia induction	\n \n\n \n–1	–1\nRocuronium 0.6 mg kg	Rocuronium 0.6 mg kg\n \n\n \nTracheal intubation	Tracheal intubation\n \n\n \nRocuronium infusion to PTC 0-1 and bolus of	Saline infusion (placebo) and bolus of\n	–1\nsaline (placebo) just before incision	rocuronium 0.1 mg kg just before incision\n \nEvaluation of surgical conditions every 30 min\nIf poor surgical conditions\n \nFirst choice: increased depth of anaesthesia	First choice: increased depth of anaesthesia\n	–1\nSecond choice: bolus saline (placebo)	Second choice: bolus rocuronium 0.15 mg kg\n \nReversal of NMB:\n–1\nIf TOF>2:      Sugammadex 2 mg kg\n–1\nIf PTC≥1:      Sugammadex 4 mg kg\n–1\nIf PTC<1:      Sugammadex 16 mg kg\nIf TOF>0.90:  placebo reversal (NaCl) was administered \n \nLost to follow up (n=0)	Lost to follow up (n=0)\nAnalysed (n=65)	Analysed (n=63)\n \nFig 1 Flow diagram\n \nTable 1 Surgical rating scale\n \n1.

Forearm and ulnar fingers were immobilized and the acceleration transducer was placed on the thumb using a Hand AdapterVR (MSD, Ballerup, Denmark). Response to ulnar nerve stimulation was recorded with a TOF-WatchVR SX (MSD, Ballerup, Denmark) every 15s. When no response to TOF stimu-lation occurred PTC was measured every three to five min. Data were collected on a computer using the TOF-Watch SX monitor program (version 2.5 INT 2007, Organon, Oss, The Netherlands). Once the patient was unconscious a 50Hz tetanic stimulus was applied for five s, and after baseline stabilization (<5% variation in at least two min), supramaximal stimulation and calibration was ensured using the calibration function (CAL 2).\nAnaesthesia\nAn epidural catheter was placed preoperatively, and a test dose of 3ml of lidocaine 20mg ml 1 with adrenalin was installed. No further medicine was given in the epidural catheter until after closure of the abdominal wall. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2mg kg 1 and remifentanil 1.0 mgkg 1 min 1. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol 0.5mg kg 1 h 1 and\n 1 min 1,\nremifentanil 0.25–0.5 mgkg and adjusted according to depth of anaesthesia under guidance of arterial blood pressure and entropy 30–50 (Entropy Sensor, GE Healthcare, Hillerød, Denmark). The protocol allowed change to sevoflurane anaes-thesia during surgery if the attending anaesthetist deemed this necessary.\nVentilation was performed with pressure control modus with tidal volume 7ml kg 1.\nDuring induction, patients received 100% oxygen. After intubation patients received 50% oxygen, PEEP of 5cm H2O and a respiratory frequency of 10-12min 1\n, aiming at normocapnia (end tidal CO2 between 4.5–5.5kPa).\nBlinding\nIntervention medicine was prepared in the operating room before surgery under double control by a nurse anaesthetist and by the investigator who also performed the randomization. The TOF-Watch and the arm with the neuromuscular equipment were covered and the readings from the TOF-Watch were only seen on the connected computer by the nurse anaesthetist and the investigator. The surgeon and any surgical personnel were blinded to the patients’ group allocation.\nOutcomes\nPrimary outcome was the score for the surgical conditions of a patient defined as the average of all scores provided during the surgical procedure. The secondary outcomes were surgical rat-ing score during fascial closure, number of patients with need for intervention (increased depth of anaesthesia or NMB/saline (placebo)) during fascial closure, number of patients with need for intervention (increased depth of anaesthesia or NMB/saline (placebo)) to optimize surgical conditions, frequencies of surgi-cal rating scores of 1 or 2 in each patient, number of patients with need for increasing the initial incision, number of patients with sudden retractions during the procedure (bucking or coughing), operating time, wound dehiscence (up to three weeks after operation), and wound infection, which required surgical drainage (up to three weeks after operation).\nTo identify adverse events and reactions an investigator con-tacted the patients between the 7th and 28th postoperative day. The patient’s file was screened in the same period.19\nStatistics\nNormally distributed variables were reported by means and standard deviations; variables that are not normally distributed were reported by medians and ranges. Student’s t-test was used to compare normally distributed variables and the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare ordinal or continuous vari-ables that were not normally distributed. Likewise, the v2 test or Fisher’s exact test was used for comparison of frequencies. Analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 19 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) and risk differences20 were calculated using the statistical software \"R\" package \"Epi\" function \"ci.pd\" version 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A P value<0.05 was considered significant.\nThe sample size was based on the overall surgical conditions scores. One single-surgeon study comparing surgical conditions estimated on a 5- point rating scale during laparoscopic prosta-tectomy and partial nephrectomy reported a significant differ-ence between treatments with a mean rating of 4.0 during moderate NMB (TOF 1-2) and 4.7 during deep NMB (PTC 1-2).21 In this present study, which embraced a wider array of surgical procedures and surgeons participating, a somewhat higher level of variability was anticipated and somewhat lower differences between treatments. An effect size of half a standard deviation was, nevertheless, considered feasible and of clinical rele-vance.22 With a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided), a sample size of 64 patients in each group would provide 80% power.\nResults\nA total of 269 patients were eligible of which 59 were excluded (six patients with mesh, 42 did not consent, six did not speak Danish, one with allergy to NMBDs, two with monitoring difficul-ties, and two with impaired kidney function) (Fig. 1). The remain-ing 82 patients did not participate because of logistic reasons (an investigator was not available at all days during the week). A total of 128 patients were included in the study (Table 2).\nIn Group DEEP, the average of surgical ratings were signifi-cantly better compared with Group STANDARD; 4.75 (range 3-5) vs 4.00 (range 1-5) (P<0.001), respectively (Table 3). During fascial closure surgeons gave better ratings of surgical conditions in Group DEEP compared with Group STANDARD (P<0.001) (Tables 3 and 4).\nEleven patients (17%) in Group DEEP needed an intervention, either increased depth of anaesthesia or bolus of NMBD to opti-mize surgical conditions compared with 31 patients (49%) in Group STANDARD (P<0.001), risk difference 32% (95%CI: 16%– 46%) (Table 5). During fascial closure no patients needed an intervention to optimize surgical conditions in Group DEEP compared with 11 (17%) patients in Group STANDARD (P<0.001), risk difference 17% (95%CI: 8% - 29%) (Table 5).\nFive different surgeons performed all operations. Surgeon \ns use of category 1 or 2 ratings of surgical conditions occurred in 11 patients (17%) in Group DEEP compared with 34 patients (54%) in Group STANDARD (P<0.001), risk difference 37% (95%CI: 21% - 51%) (Table 5).\nIn one patient in Group STANDARD, there was a need to increase the initial incision. In Group STANDARD the surgeons registered sudden retractions in 11 patients (17%) compared with none in Group DEEP (P<0.001), risk difference 17% (95%CI: 8% - 29%) (Table 5).\nNo differences were found in duration of surgery; mean 195min (SD 111) in Group DEEP compared with mean 191min (SD 109) in Group STANDARD (P¼0.837). No differences was found in\n \nDeep neuromuscular block during laparotomy | 439\n \nanaesthesia time; mean 276min (SD 116) in Group DEEP com-pared with mean 268min (SD 114) in Group STANDARD (P¼0.68). No differences were found in occurrence of wound dehiscence or wound infection requiring surgical drainage (Table 5). No dif-ference was found in average ratings of surgical conditions between the five surgeons (P¼0.733).\nSugammadex was administered in all 65 patients (100%) in Group DEEP and in 9 patients (14%) in group STANDARD. No patients were reintubated and all patients had a TOF ratio>0.90 for at least two min before extubation.\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrated that continuous deep NMB during upper abdominal laparotomy resulted in better ratings of surgi-cal conditions compared with a standard NMB regimen. This improvement of ratings was seen both during surgery and at\nTable 2 Patient characteristics\nGroup deep Group standard\nNMB NMB\nn¼65 n¼63\nAge [yr; mean (range)] 63 (31–78) 65 (35–85)\nBMI [kg/m2; mean (SD)] 26.0 (4.7) 25.0 (4.6)\nASA I/II/III 10/46/9 1/44/17\nNumber of patients with 46 (71) 39 (62)\nprevious abdominal sur-\ngery (%)\nFemale patients (%) 42 46\nType of laparotomy (liver 28/65 (43) 27/63 (43)\nresection) (%)\nType of laparotomy (not liver 37/65 (57) 36/63 (57)\nresection) (%)\nWhipple (36) (%) 18/36 (50) 18/36 (50)\nGastrectomy (10) (%) 3/10 (30) 7/10 (70)\nGastric resection (2) (%) 2 (100) 0\nResection of pancreas with 2/6 (33) 4/6 (66)\nsplenectomy (6) (%)\nPancreas resection (5) (%) 1/5 (20) 4/5 (80)\nSplenectomy (3) (%) 3 (100) 0\nBillroth II resection (1) (%) 1 (100) 0\nHepaticojejunostomy (1) (%) 0 1 (100)\nOpen pancreas biopsy (2) (%) 1/2 (50) 1/2 (50)\nOpen resection of the bile 1/2 (50) 1/2 (50)\nduct (2) (%)\nLaparotomy other (4) (%) 4 (100) 0\nOpen biopsy of gallbladder 1 (100) 0\n(1) (%)\nthe fascial closure. Also deep NMB prevented sudden muscle retractions during surgery.\nIt is relevant to mention that this study did not compare a deep NMB with moderate NMB (TOF 1-3).18 Instead deep NMB was compared with a pragmatic design reflecting a standar-dized clinical practice, allowing the anaesthetist to either increase depth of anaesthesia or administer a bolus of NMBD at their discretion. The study applied a deep NMB corresponding to PTC 0-1 as this level in experimental studies has been shown to abolish hiccups (i.e. total NMB of the diaphragm during suction-ing of the lungs in patients anaesthetized with either i.v. or inhalation agents).11\nIt is possible that our results could be explained by the con-tinuous administration of a NMBD. A continuous administration establishes a somewhat more stable block compared with bolus administration, where the level of NMB fluctuates during sur-gery. Accordingly, a continuous moderate NMB compared with our standard NMB regimen, could have provided the same results indicating that total block of the abdominal muscles may not be needed if patients are sufficiently anaesthetized. A few previous studies on laparotomy indicate that less than com-plete NMB of the abdominal muscles can achieve adequate sur-gical conditions. A study23 from 1966 reported that 90 to 95% block of EMG transmission obtained excellent surgical condi-tions along with a study from 199024 reporting that a TOF ratio<10% was required during skin incision and abdominal wall closure, whereas the requirement for NMB was minimal during major parts of surgery. Similar results were found in two\n25 26 It is though important to emphasize that other studies.\nthese studies had considerable risk of bias as a result of the lack\n12 of blinding of surgeons and to their non-randomized designs.\n1 investigated One previous blinded, randomized study by King\nthe effect of NMB on surgical conditions during open prostatec-tomy and found that surgeons gave better ratings when NMB was titrated towards TOF count   1 compared with a control\nTable 4 Distribution of surgical rating scores during fascial\nclosure\nGroup\nDeep Standard Total\nNMB (%) NMB (%)\nSurgical rating 1 0 (0) 11 (18) 11\n(score 1–5) 2 0 (0) 0 (0) 0\n3 5 (8) 11 (18) 16\n4 5 (8) 15 (24) 20\n5 53 (84) 25 (40) 78\nTotal 63 62 125\n \nTable 3 Surgical rating scores. *P<0.001 Mann-Whitney U-test. **P<0.001 Mann-Whitney U-test\n \nAverage of surgical rating scores*		Surgical rating score during fascial closure**\nMedian Range	IQR	Median Range IQR\n \n\n \nGroup Deep NMB	4.75	3–5	4.25–5	5	3–5	5–5\nGroup Standard NMB	4.00	1–5	3.33–4.67	4	1–5	3–5\n \n440 | Madsen et al.\n \n				group receiving no NMB.

Introduction\nIn2006,Gijsenbergetal.publishedastudyin Anesthesiology describ-ing the ﬁrst human use of sugammadex, a modiﬁed γ-cyclodextrin de-veloped for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents, particularly rocuronium [1]. After injection, sugammadex encapsulates and inactivates unbound rocuronium (or vecuronium) by forming tight 1:1 water-soluble com-plexes.Sodoing,sugammadexcreatesaconcentrationgradientfavoring movement of rocuronium (or vecuronium) from the neuromuscular junction into the plasma, which quickly reverses rocuronium (or vecuronium)-induced NMB [2]. This mechanism of action differs from that of neostigmine, the agent traditionally used for reversal of NMB [2,3]. Neostigmine acts as a reversible, competitive inhibitor of acetyl-cholinesterase to prolong the presence of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft after its release from cholinergic nerve endings [3,4]. As a result, acetylcholine competitively antagonizes neuromuscular blocking agents at the postsynaptic nicotinic receptor, thus restoring neuromus-cular function [3,4].\nThis difference in mechanism between sugammadex and neostig-mine results in faster NMB reversal with sugammadex [5–7].After 10 years, the superiority of sugammadex over neostigmine has been established with respect to the efﬁcacy of reversing rocuronium-in-duced NMB [5–7]. Compared with neostigmine, sugammadex is faster in reversing NMB, regardless of the depth of the block, and is associated with a lower risk of postoperative residual curarization after extubation [5,8]. However, sugammadexis notuniversally effective [9], andresidu-al neuromuscular block may still occur after sugammadex reversal [10]. Mostreportedcases,however,occurredwiththeuseofqualitativeNMB monitoring(insteadof quantitative monitoring, asrecommended) and/ or after the administration of an inadequate dose of sugammadex [9]. These cases likely represent inappropriate use rather than failure of the drug [10,11]. Sugammadex is generally well tolerated and associat-ed with a signiﬁcantly lower likelihood of postoperative adverse effects compared with neostigmine [5].\nThe difference in efﬁcacy between sugammadex and neostigmine mayleadtomorerapiddischargetothesurgicalwardinpatientsreceiv-ingsugammadex [8,12,13,14].Themagnitudeof this effecthas notbeen established, but it deserves attention because of the potential implica-tions for clinical practice. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this issue.\n2. Materials and methods\nClinicaltrialsandobservationalstudiescomparingsugammadexand neostigmine for reversing NMB induced by aminosteroid neuromuscu-larblockingagentsinpatientsundergoinggeneralanesthesiawerecon-sidered. The following inclusion criteria were used for the quantitative meta-analysis: sugammadex use for reversal of rocuronium (or vecuronium)-induced NMB, neostigmine use for reversal of NMB as thecomparator,Englishlanguage,andadultpatients(≥18years).Exclu-sion criteria were nonclinical or pediatric studies, lack of available data or a full text version of the article.\nA comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Sci-ence,GoogleScholar,andCochraneLibraryelectronicdatabasestoiden-tify English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published betweenJanuary 1, 2005 and August 1, 2016. Usingthe “AND” function, the “sugammadex” term was combined with the following Medical Subject Headings terms: “neostigmine”, “anesthesia”, “neuromuscular\nblockade”, “neuromuscular blocking agents”, “operating rooms”, “re-covery room”, “patient discharge”, and “postoperative period”. To im-prove the search accuracy, searches were repeated using “selective relaxant binding agent”, “org 25969”,and“Bridion®” instead of “sugammadex”.\nMeta-analysis of data was performed according to the Cochrane guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement [15]. Two authors (FZ, NL) in-dependentlyevaluatedthetitle,abstract,andfullmanuscriptsofarticles retrieved by the search strategy and selected the studies. A third author (CO) intervened in cases of discrepancy between the two original au-thors.Authors oftheselected studies were contacted to request missing data [15].\nThe primary endpoint of the meta-analysis was the difference in time to postoperative discharge from the operating room (OR) to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) between sugammadex and neostig-mine. The secondary endpoint was the difference in time to postopera-tive discharge from the PACU to the surgical ward between sugammadex and neostigmine. We have considered, when possible, both the actual time when the patients were discharged from the OR or PACU, and the time of OR or PACU discharge-readiness, deﬁned as thetimefollowing administrationof thestudydrug whentheattending anesthesiologist deemed the patient medically ready to leave the OR or PACU [8]. Data regarding both the number of patients and mean time values were collected and analyzed.\n2.1. Statistical analysis\nMeta-analyses were performed within a frequentist framework, computing the mean difference and 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for continuous outcome data. Both random and ﬁxed effects models were used for the meta-analyses. The random-effects model was computed with inverse-variance weighting using the DerSimonian and Laird method to account for heterogeneity. Heterogeneity across studies\n2 statistic. A threshold value of P b 0.1 was was quantiﬁed using the I\n2 value used to determine whether heterogeneity was present. An I N50% was considered substantial. If the number of included studies were very small, then it would be impossible to estimate the be-\n2\ntween-studiesvariance(τ ) with anyprecision.In this event, theresults of the Q test would be considered to identify substantial heterogeneity. Due to the limited number of studies, funnel plots and tests for funnel plot asymmetry could not be used to assess potential publication bias. All P-valueswere2-tailed,withstatisticalsigniﬁcancesetat b0.05.Com-putationswereperformedwiththeR(version3.1.2forWindows)pack-age “meta” (Schwarzer, G.; meta: General Package for Meta-Analysis; R package version 4.2–0.2015).\n3. Results\n3.1. Study selection and characteristics\nOf the 1620 reports initially identiﬁed in the literature, 1614 records were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. There-fore, six studies involving 518 patients were eligible for meta-analysis [8,12,13,16–18] (Table 1). The PRISMA ﬂow diagram of the study selec-tion protocol is presented in Fig. 1. The risk of bias summary and graph are shown in Fig. 2. Generally, the included studies exhibited a low or unclear risk of bias. A random effects model was considered the most appropriate and, therefore, used in subsequent analyses.\n \n40 M.

Discussion\nThis study provides evidence that sugammadex has the potential to acceleratepatientdischarge.Theevidenceisclearfordischargefromthe OR to PACU and less evident for discharge from PACU to the surgical ward. Our ﬁndingsmaybeexplainedbythedifferentmechanismsofac-tion through which sugammadex and neostigmine act to reverse NMB [5]. However, the different mechanisms may not be sufﬁcient to completely explain the observed differences in discharge time; there-fore, other aspects should be considered.\nSugammadex has been previously shown to speed recovery from NMB, as well as from general anesthesia. In their RCT, Jones et al. showed that 70% of patients who received sugammadex for reversal of\nrocuronium-induced NMB were awake and oriented after tracheal extubation and before transfer to the PACU. In comparison, only 59% of patients who received neostigmine had similar alertness at the time of transfer to the PACU [19]. Similarly, Khuenl-Brady et al. found that after general anesthesia, a higher percentage of patients who received sugammadex were awake and oriented before transfer to the recovery room than those treated with neostigmine [20]. Although the issue is still under debate, sugammadex seems to induce arousal from intrave-nous anesthesia [21]. The most probable explanation is the afferentation (muscle spindle) theory [21,22]. This theory states that afferent signals generated in muscle stretch receptors reach arousal centers in the brain to induce arousal via afferent nerve pathways. This implies that NMB has a sedative effect by decreasing afferent input and subsequent stimula-tion of brain arousal centers [22,23]. Sugammadex and neostigmine nul-lify this effect, which may explain how they induce arousal, sugammadex faster than neostigmine [22,23]. Encapsulation of propofol or remifentanil by sugammadex after intravenous anesthesia is unlikely because sugammadex has weak afﬁnity for these drugs [21,22].\nSugammadex also seems to be associated with superior recovery of respiratory function after anesthesia compared with neostigmine [24]. A study using diaphragmatic electromyography showed that tidal\n \nFig. 3. Time to discharge from the operating room to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Sugammadex allows faster discharge of patients from the operating room to the PACU than neostigmine.\n \n42 M. Carron et al. / Journal of Clinical Anesthesia 39 (2017) 38–44\n \nFig. 4. Time fordischarge-readiness from theoperatingroomtothepost-anesthesia careunit(PACU). Sugammadexallowsfasterdischarge-readiness ofpatients fromtheoperating room to the PACU than neostigmine.\n \nvolume (P = 0.013) and arterial oxygenation (P = 0.03) following tra-cheal extubation were higher after sugammadex compared with neo-stigmine, thus reﬂecting better recovery of diaphragm-driven inspiration after sugammadex [25]. Two independent meta-analyses demonstrated that sugammadex reduced signs of residual postopera-tive curarization [5,7]. Sugammadex was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower likelihood of postoperative weakness (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, 95% CI (0.21–0.97), P = 0.040) and adverse events (OR = 0.47, 95% CI (0.34–0.66), P b 0.0001), particularly respiratory adverse events (OR = 0.36, 95% CI (0.14–0.95), P = 0.038) and cardiovascular adverse events (OR = 0.23, 95% CI (0.08–0.61), P = 0.0036) [5]. Abad-Gurumeta et al. reported that sugammadex was associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced risk of minor respiratory events compared with neostigmine, although the lower risk of critical respiratory events did not reach statistical signif-icance (relative risk = 0.13, 95% CI (0.02–1.06), P = 0.06) [7].Thereare, however, limited data on how these ﬁndings impact patient outcomes [24]. To date, sugammadex seems to improve postoperative pulmonary outcome in populations at risk [26], most probably because of more efﬁ-cient reversal of NMB with less residual paralysis [14,24].\nNeostigmine requires a muscarinic antagonist (e.g., glycopyrrolate or atropine) to counteract its cholinergic side effects, such as bradycar-dia, hypotension, and bronchoconstriction. Adverse effects associated with the use of muscarinic antagonists include tachycardia, dry mouth, and urinary retention [6]. Furthermore, if administered incor-rectly, neostigmine may either be ineffective or produce undesirable paradoxical effects (i.e., neostigmine-induced weakness) [9,39]. These drawbacks are avoidedwithsugammadex [5,6]. Althoughseveral larger studies have established the safety of sugammadex [11], drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of the drug [6,11]. A review of 15 cases reported that drug-induced hyper-sensitivity occurred 4 min or less after drug administration; therefore, clinicians should be aware of this possibility during the critical 5-min period immediately following sugammadex injection [27]. Sugammadex has also been demonstrated to have a limited and tran-sient effect on prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time [28–30]. These effects, however, are likely due to interaction with phospholipids contained in theassays, suggestingthat they are artifacts of the commercial phospholipid-dependent assays [30]. It is unlikely\nthat sugammadex administered at the end of a surgical procedure will cause clinically signiﬁcant bleeding [31].\nThe studies included in the meta-analysis used a train-of-four (TOF) ratioof0.9,measuredbyquantitativeneuromuscularmonitoring,asthe threshold for tracheal extubation [8,12,13,16–18]. A TOF ratio of 0.9 is generally considered to be an indication of sufﬁcient recovery from NMB [31]. However, it does not imply complete recovery from NMB [31–33], anditmaystillbeassociatedwithsignsofincompleterecovery of respiratory function [34–37]. Recovery with sugammadex adminis-tered accordingto therecommendeddosemayhave ensuredfullrever-sal from NMB (TOF ratio ≥ 1.0), leading to faster recovery of respiratory function after general anesthesia than neostigmine [5–8].Evaluationof RCTs that investigated the degree of recovery at the time of tracheal extubation showed that TOF ratio values were signiﬁcantly higher in patients treated with sugammadex than those treated with neostigmine (mean difference in TOF ratio = 0.18, 95% CI (0.14, 0.22), P b 0.0001, I2 = 18.5%) [5]. Incomplete recovery of postoperative neuromuscular func-tion, even to a degree that does not evoke signs of residual curarization, may be associated with delayed discharge to the surgical ward [38].\nVarious pharmacoeconomic evaluations suggest that sugammadex maybecosteffective [14,40,41].Amodel-analysisshowedthatiftheac-tual timesavingachieved in practice is,for example, 15 or 20 min in the OR, sugammadex administered for reversal of moderate NMB is cost ef-fective if the value of the time saved is at least £ 3.83 or £ 2.87 per min, respectively [40]. As the time saved by using sugammadex instead of neostigmine decreases, the value of the time saved for each min in the OR must increase for sugammadex to remain cost effective [40].\nSeveral other issues related to costs should be considered as well. First, compared with neostigmine, sugammadex may reduce the risk of prolonged tracheal extubation, which may lead to delayed OR exit by at least 11.3 min when extubation time is prolonged N15 min [42], or blockage of the normal ﬂow of patients through the OR [8,43]. Sugammadex may also reduce the risk of prolonged PACU discharge [38]. These events increase costs: OR stays typically cost £ 4.44 to € 10.8 per min [40,14,44], and PACU stays typically cost € 0.35 to £ 0.33 per min [40,14]. Furthermore, delayed discharge from the OR increases the likelihood of cancelling subsequent scheduled surgical procedures or requiring OR personnel to work overtime, which represents an\n \nFig. 5. Time to discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) to the surgical ward. Use of sugammadex results in a signiﬁcantly shorter time to discharge from the PACU to the surgical ward compared with neostigmine.\n \nM.

Second, sugammadex may reduce costs by reducing postoperative complications compared with neostig-mine [5,13]. In a prospective randomized study, this reduction was 15.5% of the total costs for patients undergoing surgery for obstructive sleep apnea [13]. Third, using anesthetic drugs that increase the predictivity of recovery from general anesthesia may reduce OR turn-over time [45], which may, in turn, increase productivity. Sokolovic et al.foundthatdecreasingturnovertimebetweenconsecutiveoperations by 13 min increased OR occupancy by 1 h per day [46]. In a prospective study, Cendán et al. showed that reducing OR turnover time by 16 min increased the mean number of cases completed by surgeons per day from 1.78 to 2.34 (P b 0.001) [47]. In a simulation-based analysis (4 ORs, 4200 patients over 1 year), use of sugammadex shortened the du-rationofrecoveryby5to10min,resultinginupto2.4%additionalcases during similar working hours and planning periods [48]. In morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, the in-crease in productivity (extra cases) with the use of sugammadex was estimatedtobeupto24%[49].\nThe economic beneﬁts of sugammadex may be particularly relevant when ORs represent a variable cost, not a ﬁxed cost [42,50]. Variable costs are generally applicable when essentially all (e.g., N90%) ORs at a hospital have N8 h of cases each workday. In such situations, there is a rationale to reduce the likelihood that patient discharge will be prolonged [42,50]. Moreover, increased productivity may be associated with a reduction in stafﬁng costs. In their analysis, Dexter et al. showed that reducing average turnover times by 3 to 9 min would reduce stafﬁng costs by 0.8% to 1.8%, whereas reducing average turnover times by 10 to 19 min would reduce stafﬁng costs by 2.5% to 4.0% [51].\nAlthough anesthesiologists may employ strategies to reduce the time spent in the PACU [52], a large number of factors affect the time to discharge to the surgical ward [53,54]. Medical personnel accounted for N50% of the delays [53] and delays related to “system problems” accounted for approximately 25% of the time patients spent in the PACU [55]. By far the major determinant of PACU costs is the distribu-tion of admissions [52]. However, delayed discharge of some patients signiﬁcantly increases the likelihood of other patients being required to wait to enter the PACU. In this way, delayed discharge can lead to considerable costs and may cause cancellation of subsequent scheduled surgical procedures [42].\nWe acknowledge some limitations of the present work. First, the number of included studies is limited. Further data are required to sup-port the beneﬁts of sugammadex compared with neostigmine in accel-erating discharge. Second, heterogeneity across studies was considerable for the PACU discharge results. Signiﬁcant statistical het-erogeneity suggests an inconsistency among estimates that needs to beaddressed.However,itwasnotpossibletoexplorethisheterogeneity because of the limited number of included studies. Finally, the meta-analyses were performed using arithmetic means instead of geometric means because the latter were not available.\nAfter receiving marketing approval in Europe in 2008 and Asia in 2010,sugammadex wasapprovedintheUnited Statesin2015andCan-ada in 2016. These recent approvals will provideopportunities for addi-tional research to support the ﬁndings of the current report.

The moderate group received less rocuronium intra-operatively, but despite this, recovery to TOF 0.9 was signiﬁcantly slower than that seen in the deep group (Table 3). Anaesthetic and surgical times were similar in both groups (Table 3).\nFewer patients in the moderate group achieved acceptable surgical rating and patient satisfaction scores compared with the deep group (Tables 3 and 4). The time to ﬁrst bowel movement after surgery did not differ signiﬁcantly between the groups, although more patients in the moderate group complained of a dry mouth 24 h postoperatively (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to use IAP alarms during pneumoperitoneum as an indicator of surgical conditions.

Hypersensitivity is unlikely to be mediated through sugammadex-speciﬁc immunoglobulin G- or E-mediated mast cell stimulation in healthy volunteers. Clinical trial registration: NCT02028065.\n \nKeywords: anaphylaxis; hypersensitivity; sugammadex; neuromuscular block\n \nEditor’s key points\n  The incidence and severity of hypersensitivity in\nresponse to sugammadex are not known.\n  Healthy volunteers received repeated injections of\n 1\neither sugammadex 4 or 16 mg kg , or placebo, sepa-\nrated by a ~5 week interval, and the presence or\nabsence of hypersensitivity was assessed.\n  Hypersensitivity in response to sugammadex admin-\nistration can occur in healthy subjectswithouta history\nof previous sugammadex exposure.\nSugammadex, a cyclodextrin derivative, provides rapid reversal of moderate or deep rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced\n 1 neuromuscular block at doses of 2 and 4 mg kg ,\n1e6  1\nrespectively. At a dose of 16 mg kg , sugammadex is also effective for the reversal of blockade 3 min after an intubating\n 1\ndose of rocuronium 1.2 mg kg when there is an immediate\n7\nneed to reverse the neuromuscular block. Sugammadex received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in December 2015, and is currently marketed for use in >70 coun-tries worldwide. Sugammadex is generally well tolerated, but a low incidence of hypersensitivity has been observed in clinical\n8,9\nstudies ; hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis events have also\n10e17\nbeenreportedpost-marketing. Therefore,apreviousrepeat-dose placebo-controlled study was conducted in 448 healthy, non-anaesthetised subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer NCT00988065; sponsor protocol number P06042). Hypersensi-tivity was adjudicatedinseven(4.7%), one(0.7%),andzero (0.0%)\n 1\nsubjects receiving sugammadex 16 and 4 mg kg ,andplacebo, respectively. There was one case of anaphylaxis in the sugam-\n 1\nmadex 16 mg kg treatment group adjudicated using the\n18\nSampsoncriteria. However,protocoldeviationswereidentiﬁed after study completion, some of which may have compromised thestudyblinding,whichcouldintroducebiasintheassessment of incidence of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis.\nTherefore, the current study was conducted to characterise further the potential risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis after initial and repeat exposures to sugammadex in healthy, non-anaesthetised adult subjects. The exploratory objectives included measurement of concentrations of anti-sugammadex-speciﬁc immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgE anti-bodies, and mast-cell tryptase concentrations.\nMethods\nStudy design and subjects\nThis randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study (protocol MK-8616-101; NCT02028065) was conducted at four study centres in the USA and two in Belgium. Subjects aged\n 2\n18e55 yr, with BMI  19 and  32 kg m , and judged to be in good health, based on medical history, physical examination,\nvital-sign measurements, ECG, and capillary-reﬁll-time mea-surements, were enrolled. The exclusion criteria are sum-marised in Supplementary methods. The study was conducted in accordance with principles of Good Clinical Practice, and was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards and regulatory agencies. Written informed consent was ob-tained from all participating subjects.\nThe subjects were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio, using a computer-generated allocation schedule, to receive three\n 1\nrepeat i.v. bolus injections of sugammadex 4 mg kg , sugam-\n 1\nmadex 16 mg kg , or placebo (normal saline), with an approx-imate 5 week period between each dose, to allow potential sensitisation to develop. Each i.v. bolus injection was adminis-tered in approximately 10 s to match closely clinical practice.\nHypersensitivity assessment\nHypersensitivity was deﬁned as objectively reproducible symptoms and signs of allergic disease initiated by exposure to a deﬁned stimulus at a dose tolerated by non-hypersensitive persons.\nTargeted hypersensitivity assessments were performed at 0.5, 4, and 24 h after dosing. The assessment included elicita-tion of symptoms and examination of the subject, covering neurological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and dermatological domains (Supplementary methods). The assessment was performed by a blinded investigator not involved in the preparation or administration of the study drug. To ensure subject safety, a physician with expertise in airway management was available to treat the subject if se-vere hypersensitivity symptoms were to occur during the ﬁrst 4 h after dosing. Hypersensitivity signs or symptoms in the ﬁrst 24 h after dosing were referred to a blinded independent Clinical Adjudication Committee for evaluation by allergy and anaesthesia experts (Table 1).\nThe Sampson criteria are generally accepted as the best deﬁnition of anaphylaxis, and were developed via a large collaborative group, including the National Institute of Allergy\n18\nand Infectious Diseases. Sampson Criterion 1 is deﬁned as acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvementoftheskin,mucosaltissue,orboth(e.g.generalised hives,pruritusorﬂushing,andswollenlipsetongueeuvula),and at least one of the following: (i) respiratory compromise [e.g. dyspnoea, wheezing/bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory ﬂow (PEF), and hypoxaemia], and (ii) reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction [e.g. hypotonia (collapse), syncope, and incontinence]. Criterion 1 is limited to reactions, in which the affected subject is not known to be allergic to the potential allergen.

In total, 382 subjects were randomised, 375 received treatment\n 1  1\n(sugammadex 4 mg kg : n¼151; 16 mg kg : n¼148; and pla-cebo: n¼76) and 334 (89.1%) completed the study and received all three doses of the assigned treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). The overall mean (range) age was 38 (19e56) yr, BMI\n 2\nwas 26.3 (18.7e32.0) kg m , and 53% of the subjects were fe-male. The patient and baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups (Table 2).\nHypersensitivity\nOverall,94subjectswithatotalof137adverseeventspotentially consistent with hypersensitivity based on the targeted hyper-sensitivity assessments were referred to the Clinical Adjudica-tion Committee. Of these, 25 subjects were identiﬁed with\nadjudicated hypersensitivity after receiving at least one dose of study medication: 10 (6.6%; 95% CI: 3.2e11.8) and 14 (9.5%; 95%\n 1 CI: 5.3e15.4) subjects receiving sugammadex 4 and 16 mg kg , respectively, and one (1.3%; 95% CI: 0.0e7.1) randomised to placebo (Table 3). In 13 subjects, the onset of the ﬁrst hyper-sensitivity symptoms occurred within 10 min after the dose administration. All subjects but one had symptoms that began within 1 h of the dose administration. One subject had delayed mild hypersensitivity symptoms 22 h post-dose. In total, 43 adjudicated hypersensitivity events were experienced by these 25 subjects. The incidence of conﬁrmed hypersensitivity was similar across sugammadex dose groups and dosing occasions (Figs 1 and 2). A summary of adverse events experienced by those with conﬁrmed hypersensitivity is shown in Table 4.\nOverall, 39/43 (91%) hypersensitivity events were of mild severity; three were moderate and one was considered severe\n 1\n(these four events occurred in the 16 mg kg group) (Fig. 1). There was no clear evidence of an increase in the incidence or severity of hypersensitivity with repeated administration of sugammadex. In the 24 sugammadex subjects with hyper-sensitivity, 21 received all three doses: 11 subjects had an\n 1 event on more than one occasion, with three in the 4 mg kg\n \nTable 2 Subject characteristics (all-subjects-as-treated population)\n \nn (%)	Sugammadex 4 mg kg¡1	Sugammadex 16 mg kg¡1	Placebo\n	(n¼151)	(n¼148)	(n¼76)\n \n\n \nSex			\nMale	68 (45.0)	68 (45.9)	41 (53.9)\nFemale	83 (55.0)	80 (54.1)	35 (46.1)\nAge (yr)			\nMean (range)	39 (19e55)	38 (20e55)	38 (21e56)\nBMI (kg m 2)			\nMean (SD)	26.3 (3.3)	26.5 (3.3)	26.2 (3.3)\nRace			\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native	2 (1.3)	0 (0.0)	1 (1.3)\nBlack/African American	17 (11.3)	16 (10.8)	9 (11.8)\nMultiple	1 (0.7)	2 (1.4)	1 (1.3)\nNative Hawaiian/Paciﬁc Islander	1 (0.7)	1 (0.7)	0 (0.0)\nWhite	130 (86.1)	129 (87.2)	65 (85.5)\n \nTable 3 Subjects with conﬁrmed hypersensitivity* or anaphylaxis according to Sampson (Criterion 1).

The remaining 3 of 24 subjects (all from\n 1\nthe 16 mg kg group) required treatment for hypersensitivity symptoms and were discontinued from the study, per the pre-speciﬁed protocol requirements, after the ﬁrst dose. The symptoms of all three subjects rapidly improved after treat-ment with antihistamines/corticosteroids, and resolved completely within 22 h after symptom onset. No subject required treatment with epinephrine.\nAnaphylaxis was conﬁrmed in one of these three subjects (Table 3; Fig. 1). This subject had an onset of initial symptoms immediately after the dose administration: mild sneezing, nasal congestion, conjunctival oedema, moderate urticaria, and swelling of the uvula, and a decrease in PEF 30% below baseline. Most symptoms resolved within 3 h of treatment with antihistamine and corticosteroid, with conjunctival oedema resolving 9 h after the dose administration; the sub-ject recovered completely without sequelae. The subject did not experience hypotension.\nThere was a numerically higher incidence of adverse events\n 1\nin the sugammadex 4 and 16 mg kg groups vs placebo (62.3% and 66.2% vs 47.4%, respectively). The most frequent adverse events within each treatment group are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

Further details are provided in Supplementary materials.\nNo clinically relevant changes were observed in any of the vital signs, PEF, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, labora-tory, ECG, or other routine safety parameters in the sugam-madex groups relative to the placebo group.\nAnti-sugammadex antibodies\nOf the 25 subjects with conﬁrmed hypersensitivity, two were positiveforanti-sugammadexIgG.Onesubjectwithadjudicated hypersensitivity on each dosing occasion had positive IgG at baseline (before receiving sugammadex), but was negative beforethesecondandthirddoses,andatthefollow-upvisit.The second subject was negative at baseline, but positive before the second and third doses, and at the follow-up visit; this subject hadanadjudicatedhypersensitivityeventaftertheseconddose, but not the third. None of the subjects with adjudicated hyper-sensitivity were positive for anti-sugammadex IgE.\nOf the 69 subjects who were referred to the Clinical Adju-dication Committee but whose events were not conﬁrmed as hypersensitivity reactions, none had anti-sugammadex IgG or IgE at any evaluated time point. Furthermore, of the 91 control subjects (who were not referred to the Clinical Adjudication Committee), none had anti-sugammadex IgG or IgE at any evaluated time point.\nOverall, these ﬁndings suggest a low likelihood of devel-oping IgE or IgG antibodies to sugammadex with repeated administration, and that antibodies to sugammadex are not associated with conﬁrmed hypersensitivity.\nTryptase\nThe upper limit of the normal range of tryptase in healthy\n 1\nsubjects is 11.4 ng ml . There were no subjects with adjudi-cated hypersensitivity with tryptase concentrations\n 1\n>11 ng ml , either pre- or post-dose. One subject had a\n 1\n 3ngml tryptase increase post-dose relative to pre-dose with the second dose of sugammadex. This subject also had adjudicated hypersensitivity reactions after the ﬁrst and third\ndoses, but did not have elevations of tryptase in those periods\n 1\nof tryptase  3ngml .\nDiscussion\nAfter repeated administration in healthy volunteers, sugam-madex was associated with a numerically higher incidence of\n 1\nhypersensitivity than placebo at both 4 and 16 mg kg ; the incidence of hypersensitivity was similar across sugammadex doses and dosing occasions. Most hypersensitivity events occurred within minutes after the sugammadex administra-tion. In three events occurring in the 148 subjects in the\n 1\nsugammadex 16 mg kg group, treatment was required with antihistamines and corticosteroids. There was no pattern of an increase in the severity of hypersensitivity reactions in the subjects who experienced hypersensitivity on more than one occasion. Thus, there was no evidence for the development of sensitisation to sugammadex in this study.\nOverall, there were no cases of anaphylaxis in the 151\n 1\nsubjects who received sugammadex 4 mg kg , the highest recommended dose for routine reversal in clinical practice. There was one case of anaphylaxis in the 148 subjects\n 1\nreceiving sugammadex 16 mg kg , which required treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids. In a surgical setting,\n 1\nthe dose of 16 mg kg is recommended only in emergency situations, when urgent reversal of neuromuscular block is required to restore spontaneous respiration and an airway cannot be established. It is unclear, however, whether the incidence of anaphylaxis is dose related, and thus, the observed incidence of anaphylaxis in this study with the administration of sugammadex to conscious, non-anaesthetised healthy subjects is 1 in 199, or 3.3%.\nIn contrast to the results of this study, no conﬁrmed cases of anaphylaxis were observed in 3230 exposures to sugam-madex during the Phases 2 and 3 sugammadex clinical development programme, which consisted almost entirely of\n 1\nsugammadex 2 or 4 mg kg doses, administered in surgical patients. There were nine sugammadex-treated patients (0.3%) with conﬁrmed hypersensitivity in this clinical trial database.

This may be due in part to increased detection rates of hypersensitivity signs and symptoms in awake vs anaesthetised subjects. Additionally, the intensive targeted hypersensitivity assessment used in the protocol of the current study is also likely to result in increased ﬁnding and reporting of relevant symptoms.\nThe mast-cell tryptase assay is considered a valuable test to\n21 detect the degranulation ofmast cells withanaphylaxis. Inthe present study, there was limited evidence of mast-cell degran-ulationbasedontheexploratorytryptasebiomarkerassays,with onesubjecthavingaslightincreaseintryptasefrombaseline,but within the upper limit of the normal range, which may be ex-pected given the mildness of the observed hypersensitivity\nreactions, with none of the subjects experiencing haemody-namic compromise. Furthermore, no anti-sugammadex IgE an-tibodies were detected in subjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity, suggesting that repeated exposure to sugam-madex may not lead to the development of anti-sugammadex IgE antibodies that could result in IgE-mediated mast-cell degranulation. There was no consistent evidence that subjects exposed to sugammadex develop anti-sugammadex IgG anti-bodies in this study. Therefore, based on an evaluation of serum tryptase concentrations and assays for anti-sugammadex anti-bodies, it is unlikely that hypersensitivity to sugammadex observed in this study is mediated through sugammadex-speciﬁc IgG- or IgE-mediated stimulation of mast cells.\nPatient characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, may\n19 play a role in predisposition to hypersensitivity reactions.\n \n756 - Min et al.\n \nSubject characteristics were balanced across groups. No sub-group analyses were conducted to assess the impact of race or ethnicity on potential hypersensitivity to sugammadex, as the low incidence of hypersensitivity cases in this study limited the utility of the investigation of subgroups. Another study limitation is that the anti-sugammadex antibody results rely on an in vitro assay, and because of lack of any reference antibody for IgE, the sensitivity of the assay for IgE antibodies could not be quantiﬁed. Finally, skin testing was not con-ducted as part of this study, as the previous study of hyper-sensitivity of sugammadex with repeated dosing in healthy subjects indicated that skin testing of subjects with hyper-sensitivity was generally negative.\nBased on this evaluation in healthy subjects, the present study indicates that hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, can occur after the administration of sugammadex in sub-jects who have not previously been exposed to sugammadex. The reporting of anaphylaxis in post-marketing and in the broader clinical programme of surgical patients indicates that the incidence in the surgical population may be lower than was observed in this study of non-anaesthetised healthy subjects. Regardless of this potential discrepancy, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of hypersensitivity with the administration of sugammadex. Sugammadex should not be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity to sugammadex. Practitioners should observe patients for po-tential hypersensitivity reactions for an appropriate period of time after the administration.\nanalysis, and interpretation of data; and data checking of information provided in the manuscript.

These symptoms were not serious or severe in intensity, and were short-lasting and self-limiting. A repeat-dose, pla-cebo-controlled study conducted in a healthy, non-anesthetized popu-lation (N= 448) detected signs of hypersensitivity in 7 subjects (4.7%) who received sugammadex 16mg/kg, 1 subject (0.7%) who received sugammadex 4mg/kg, and no subjects who received placebo. In this study, 3 subjects met the Sampson and Brighton anaphylaxis criteria (level 1, N=1; level 2, N= 2) [16,17]; however, protocol deviations that may have compromised study blinding in a subset of subjects were noted following study completion. Subsequently, a multicenter, double-blind study [18] that evaluated the incidence of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis after repeated, single-dose administration of sugammadex among 375 non-anesthetized adults showed that both the 4mg/kg (N= 151) and 16mg/kg (N= 148) doses were associated with nu-merically higher incidences (5.3% and 8.1%, respectively) of hy-persensitivity than placebo (N =76). A single case of anaphylaxis oc-curred in the 16 mg/kg treatment group. There was no evidence of apparent sensitization with repeated sugammadex administration.\nThe present pooled analysis was performed to further characterize the potential risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis following ex-posure to sugammadex among surgical patients under general an-esthesia requiring NMB and healthy volunteers who received su-gammadex or placebo together with anesthesia and/or NMB across the Phase 1–3 studies in the sugammadex clinical development program. In addition, post-marketing reports of events of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis were identiﬁed and adjudicated.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Study design\nData were pooled across all Phase 1–3 sugammadex clinical studies, comprising 42 trials, including 6 Phase 1 trials, 12 Phase 2 trials, and 23 Phase 3 trials; in addition, 1 Phase 5 trial assessing the eﬀect of su-gammadex and neostigmine on incidence of residual blockade was in-cluded for completeness (Supplemental Fig. 1). Adult surgical patients and healthy volunteers from any trial in which sugammadex 2, 4, and/ or 16 mg/kg doses, placebo and/or comparator was administered to-gether with anesthesia and/or NMB were included. In addition to the overall Phase 1 to 3 pooled population, two subsets of interest were deﬁned: 1) sugammadex compared to placebo (pooled placebo-con-trolled subgroup) and 2) sugammadex compared to neostigmine (pooled neostigmine-controlled subgroup).\nAll study protocols had been reviewed and approved by the ap-propriate Institutional Review Boards or Independent Ethics Committees. All clinical trial subjects had provided written informed consent before the initiation of any study procedure.\n2.2. Subjects and procedures\nSubjects were eligible for inclusion in the base clinical studies if they were ≥ 18years of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 1–3, and scheduled to undergo surgery under general an-esthesia requiring NMB. In general, the exclusion criteria included disorders impairing neuromuscular transmission, use of medication known to interfere with NMBAs, signiﬁcant renal dysfunction, a history of malignant hyperthermia, and allergy to medication used during general anesthesia. Subjects who were pregnant, breast feeding, or of childbearing potential and not using an adequate method of contra-ception were also excluded.\nThe anesthesia regimen in the studies was propofol for induction and propofol or sevoﬂurane for maintenance. Subjects received\nrocuronium (0.6–1.2mg/kg) or vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg) for NMB, with additional maintenance doses, as required. Comparators were placebo or neostigmine (50–70 μg/kg), which was given with the muscarinic antagonists glycopyrrolate 10 μg/kg or atropine 10–20 μg/kg. Across the studies (except for those exploring the dose range), sugammadex was administered according to 3 recommended administration sche-dules: 2.0mg/kg at reappearance of the second twitch (T2) to Train-of-Four (TOF) stimulation, 4.0 mg/kg at 1–2 post-tetanic count (PTC), or 16.0 mg/kg at 3min after rocuronium 1.2mg/kg. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed using the TOF-Watch® SX (Organon Ireland Ltd., formerly a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Swords, Co. Dublin, Ireland).\n2.3. Hypersensitivity assessment\nHypersensitivity was deﬁned as objective symptoms and signs of allergic disease initiated by exposure to a deﬁned stimulus at a dose tolerated by non-hypersensitive persons. Anaphylaxis was deﬁned ac-cording to Sampson (Criterion 1) [16]: acute onset of an illness (from minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula), and at least 1 of the following events: respiratory com-promise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory ﬂow, hypoxemia); or reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syn-cope, incontinence).\nThree methods were used to assess hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis in the pooled clinical trial database: 1) automated Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) [19] queries; 2) searches of adverse events (AEs) suggestive of hypersensitivity as diagnosed by the in-vestigator and considered treatment-related in the opinion of the in-vestigator; and 3) a retrospective adjudication of AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity by an independent adjudication committee (AC; see Appendix A for the list of hypersensitivity symptoms referred to the AC). In addition, a search of all post-marketing reports of events of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis was performed, and events were ad-judicated by an independent AC.\n2.3.1. Automated MedDRA queries\nFor the automated MedDRA query approach, the Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) for “Hypersensitivity” was used to identify clinical trial subjects who may have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction. The queries used terms from the “narrow” and “broad” sear-ches, as deﬁned within the SMQ. The “narrow” term search was used to identify events that are highly likely to represent the condition of in-terest, and the “broad” term search included identiﬁcation of all pos-sible events related to hypersensitivity and also captured terms from the “narrow” search.\nIn addition to “Hypersensitivity”, the SMQ, “Anaphylactic reaction” was used to identify subjects who may have experienced an anaphy-lactic reaction, using terms from the “narrow”, “broad” and “algo-rithmic” searches. Similar to the “Hypersensitivity” SMQ, the “narrow” search included terms that are most indicative of an anaphylactic re-action and the “broad” search included all possible anaphylactic events and also captured terms from the “narrow” search. The “algorithmic” search accounted for the fact that anaphylaxis typically involves a combination of reactions and, therefore, included the following three categories of “broad” terms: upper airway/respiratory, angioedema/ urticaria/pruritus/ﬂush, and cardiovascular/hypotension. For the “al-gorithmic” search, a subject was required to either experience an event from the “narrow” search or experience at least two events from two diﬀerent categories from the “broad” search.\n2.3.2.

Here, two criteria were required: 1) the AE was coded with a term that referred to the investigator\'s diagnosis of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, or any form of allergic reaction, excluding AEs merely suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions; and 2) the AE was considered at least possibly related to treatment in the opinion of the investigator, so as to exclude hy-persensitivity reactions that were clearly related to other sources.\n2.3.3. Retrospective adjudication of adverse events of hypersensitivity\nAn independent AC was tasked with retrospectively adjudicating all potential AEs of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis in the clinical trial database that had not previously been adjudicated. A query for AEs suggestive of hypersensitivity and/or suspected anaphylaxis was pro-cessed within the clinical trial database. The AC was presented with all potential AEs and members were strictly blinded to treatment assign-ment. The AEs forwarded for adjudication by the AC were limited to those occurring within 48h after treatment administration. The AC categorized the AEs as “hypersensitivity”, “anaphylaxis”, “unable to adjudicate”,or“no hypersensitivity”.\n2.3.4. Post-marketing reports of adverse events of hypersensitivity\nThe Sponsor\'s pharmacovigilance database was searched for post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis reactions with sugammadex that had been received from health care providers cumulatively from July 25, 2008 (market introduction) to April 22, 2015 (based on regulatory requirements for the resubmission of the sugammadex ﬁling). Serious hypersensitivity reports were identiﬁed by querying serious “broad” terms in the “Anaphylactic reaction” SMQ (excluding “narrow” terms) and serious “narrow” and “broad” terms in the “Hypersensitivity” SMQ (excluding “narrow” terms from the aforementioned SMQs). Anaphylaxis reports were identiﬁed by querying the MedDRA “narrow”“Anaphylactic reaction” SMQ, along with “narrow” terms from the “Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid shock” sub-SMQ in the “Shock” SMQ.\nAll reports containing a serious hypersensitivity term were sent for retrospective adjudication to an independent external AC, which was composed of the same Chairman and many of the same members used to adjudicate reports from the clinical trial database. The AC reviewed each report for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity and/or ana-phylaxis, using Sampson et al. criteria [16] as the basis for adjudication. The events were categorized as “hypersensitivity”, “anaphylaxis”, “unable to adjudicate”,or“no hypersensitivity”. In this paper, events described as “conﬁrmed” are those that were veriﬁed by the\nadjudication process.\n2.4. Statistical analyses\nThe diﬀerences in the incidence and 95% CI (Miettinen & Nurminen method [20]) for adverse events identiﬁed by “narrow”, “algorithmic” and “broad” searches using standardized MedDRA query “hypersensi-tivity” and “anaphylactic reaction” were estimated between the pooled sugammadex group versus the pooled placebo-controlled and neos-tigmine-controlled subgroups. All analyses were performed using the all-subjects-as-treated (ASaT) population, which consisted of all ran-domized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Subjects were included in the group corresponding to the treatment they actually received.\n3. Results\n3.1. Subject characteristics\nThe pooled Phase 1–3 dataset included 3519 unique subjects who received sugammadex and 544 who received placebo. Most subject exposures (n= 1921) were at the 4mg/kg dose of sugammadex, fol-lowed by 895 subject exposures at the 2mg/kg dose of sugammadex, the recommended doses for routine reversal of deep and moderate NMB, respectively. The remainder of subjects received other doses ranging from <2mg/kg to 32mg/kg as part of the dose-ranging and safety studies conducted during the clinical program. These data are not included in this analysis due to the small numbers of subjects in each category, except as part of the total exposures to sugammadex. A total of 98 subject exposures occurred at the 16mg/kg dose of sugammadex, a dose only recommended for an urgent or emergent reversal of NMB following administration of rocuronium.\nThe total sugammadex and placebo groups in the pooled dataset were broadly similar with respect to age, gender, race, and baseline body weight and height (Table 1). Demographic and baseline char-acteristics were generally similar between the pooled placebo-con-trolled and pooled neostigmine-controlled trials (Table 2).\n3.2. Hypersensitivity reactions\n3.2.1.

No evidence for a dose-response was observed across the sugammadex doses examined. For the hy-persensitivity “narrow” term search, the incidences for total su-gammadex and placebo were similar. For the “broad” term search, the incidences for total sugammadex and placebo were also similar. For the anaphylactic reaction “narrow” term search, the AE, circulatory col-lapse, occurred at similar incidences for total sugammadex and placebo; no events were identiﬁed in the 16mg/kg group for this category. The incidences of anaphylactic reaction were also similar for total su-gammadex and placebo for the “broad” term search and the “algo-rithmic” search.\nIn the pooled placebo-controlled subgroup (Table 4), the incidences were comparable between treatment groups for all searches.\nIn the pooled neostigmine-controlled subgroup (Table 4), the AE incidences for the SMQ search for hypersensitivity (“narrow” term and “broad” term, respectively) for exposure to sugammadex and neos-tigmine were comparable. For anaphylactic reaction, 4 AEs were identiﬁed in the SMQ “narrow” search at an incidence rate of 0.2% in each treatment group. The incidence rates for the “broad” term search were similar for exposures to sugammadex and neostigmine. The in-cidence rates for AE terms in the “algorithmic” search for exposures to sugammadex and neostigmine were also comparable.\n3.2.2. Adverse events of treatment-related hypersensitivity per the investigator\nIn the analysis of AEs of treatment-related hypersensitivity or ana-phylaxis in the pooled Phase 1–3 trial dataset, there were 11 events (0.3%) in the sugammadex group (2 events in the 2mg/kg group and 9 events in the 4mg/kg group) and 4 events (0.7%) in the placebo group. Of these, 3 AEs of hypersensitivity (all in the 4mg/kg group) and 4 AEs of drug hypersensitivity (2 events each in the 2mg/kg and 4mg/kg groups) occurred in the sugammadex group. There was no clear dose-related trend in exposures to sugammadex for these hypersensitivity events.\nIn the pooled placebo-controlled subgroup, there were 2 subjects (0.2%) in the sugammadex group and 4 subjects (0.7%) in the placebo group with AEs of treatment-related hypersensitivity. For sugammadex, both events were hypersensitivity; for placebo, there was 1 event of hypersensitivity, 1 event of drug hypersensitivity, 1 event of allergic rhinitis, and 1 event of allergic dermatitis.\nIn the pooled neostigmine-controlled subgroup, there were 7 sub-jects (0.8%) in the sugammadex group and 2 subjects (0.2%) in the neostigmine group with AEs of treatment-related hypersensitivity. For sugammadex, there were 4 events of drug hypersensitivity, 4 events of allergic dermatitis, and no events of hypersensitivity; for the neos-tigmine group, there were 2 events of drug hypersensitivity and 1 event of hypersensitivity.\n3.2.3. Retrospective adjudication of adverse events of hypersensitivity\nIn the pooled Phase 1–3 trials in subjects who received sugammadex or placebo, the AC determined that conﬁrmed hypersensitivity occurred in 9 dosing events (0.2%) in the sugammadex group, with 5 (0.56%) at 2mg/kg, and 4 (0.21%) at 4mg/kg; 3 dosing events (0.6%) in the placebo group; and 3 dosing events in the neostigmine group (0.3%); no events in any of these trials were conﬁrmed as anaphylaxis (Fig. 1). There were no cases of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis in the dose groups not included in this analysis (data not shown).\n3.2.4. Post-marketing reports of adverse events of hypersensitivity\nFrom July 25, 2008 to April 22, 2015, there were 414 post-mar-keting reports of AEs of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, of which 155 were serious hypersensitivity and 259 were anaphylaxis. Although the adjudication of the 259 reports did not agree with the initial report of anaphylaxis in all cases, as a conservative approach, all cases were counted as anaphylaxis for the purpose of this analysis. Of the 155 reports of serious hypersensitivity, 36 were conﬁrmed as hypersensi-tivity and 14 were conﬁrmed as anaphylaxis and included in the ana-phylaxis reports. Altogether, there were 273 identiﬁed cases of ana-phylaxis in the post-marketing database, approximately half of which were in males (when gender was reported). There were no common patterns identiﬁed that could identify risk factors. Of the 206 cases for which timing was reported, symptoms of anaphylaxis began within 20min of administration of sugammadex in 87% of the cases. Hypotension was reported in 71% of cases, and 104 reports included\n \nTable 3\nSubjects with adverse events identiﬁed by narrow, algorithmic and broad searches using standardized MedDRA query “hypersensitivity” and “anaphylactic reaction” (pooled phase 1–3 trials).\n \nSMQ	SMQ Search	Placebo	Sugammadex	Sugammadex	Sugammadex	Total sugammadexa\n		0 mg/kg	2mg/kg	4mg/kg	16 mg/kg	(n= 3601)\n		(n =544)	(n= 895)	(n= 1921)	(n= 98)	\n \n\n \nHypersensitivity	Narrow	14 (2.6)	28 (3.1)	66 (3.4)	4 (4.1)	113 (3.1)\n	Broad	33 (6.1)	62 (6.9)	147 (7.7)	5 (5.1)	245 (6.8)\nAnaphylactic reaction	Narrow	2 (0.4)	0 (0.0)	3 (0.2)	0 (0.0)	3 (0.1)\n	Algorithmic	3 (0.6)	5 (0.6)	20 (1.0)	0 (0.0)	30 (0.8)\n	Broad	33 (6.1)	62 (6.9)	147 (7.7)	5 (5.1)	245 (6.8)\n \nSMQ =Standardized MedDRA query.\na Total column includes subjects exposed to other doses of intravenous sugammadex (<2 to 32mg/kg).\n \n70\n \nK.C.

Fatality was reported in 4 medically complicated cases, and death occurred 3 to 19days after the event of anaphylaxis.\nTwenty-eight of the 36 reports of conﬁrmed hypersensitivity pre-sented as skin reactions, such as erythema, rash, and urticaria, and the other 8 reports were laryngospasm, bronchospasm, musculoskeletal stiﬀness, respiratory arrest, decreased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation, tongue edema and angioedema. All subjects with AEs re-sponded to standard treatment for anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reac-tions, including epinephrine, antihistamines, bronchodilators, steroids, vasopressors and ventilatory support, and fully recovered with no se-quelae. The remaining 105/155 reports were heterogeneous in nature and contained broad SMQ terms, such as bronchospasm, laryngospasm, asthma, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, respiratory arrest, dyspnea, and decreased blood pressure. Of the 155 reports of serious hy-persensitivity, there was insuﬃcient information in 21 cases to de-termine whether the Sampson criteria for anaphylaxis were met. 4. Discussion\nSeveral reports of suspected hypersensitivity following sugammadex administration in surgical patients have been published [8–15]. To in-vestigate the potential for AEs of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis with the use of sugammadex, we conducted an analysis of pooled stu-dies from the Phase 1–3 clinical trial database of subjects who received sugammadex under general anesthesia requiring NMB. Overall, 3519 subjects who received sugammadex were included in this pooled\nanalysis. The results show a low incidence of hypersensitivity, with no apparent increase in the incidence of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis with sugammadex as compared to placebo or neostigmine in the setting of anesthesia/surgery with many concomitant medications.\nThree separate methods were used in the analysis of the pooled clinical trial data: 1) automated MedDRA queries; 2) searches of treatment-related AEs of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis as diagnosed by the investigator; and 3) a retrospective adjudication of events sugges-tive of hypersensitivity by an independent AC. The ﬁrst method showed no apparent increase in hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis with su-gammadex as compared to placebo or neostigmine. Similarly, the second method showed a low overall incidence of AEs diagnosed by the investigator as drug hypersensitivity (<1%), with no evidence of a higher incidence of investigator-diagnosed, treatment-related hy-persensitivity with sugammadex compared to placebo or neostigmine. Finally, the retrospective adjudication of events suggestive of hy-persensitivity by an independent AC showed a low overall incidence of hypersensitivity (0.2%), and no cases of anaphylaxis.\nIn addition to the analyses of the clinical trial database, a compre-hensive retrospective review and adjudication of post-marketing re-ports of serious hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis was performed. At the time of this evaluation, approximately 11.5 million patients had been exposed to sugammadex since market introduction. Altogether, there were 259 reported cases of anaphylaxis and 155 cases of serious hy-persensitivity.\nThese results suggest a low incidence of hypersensitivity and ana-phylaxis associated with sugammadex administration. Events typically presented as dermatologic manifestations, followed closely by hypo-tension. Patients who experienced these events were eﬀectively\n \n5.0\n \nAnaphylaxis\n4.0 Hypersensitivity\n \nIncidence (%)\n3.0\n \n2.0\n \n	n=3	n=5	\n1.0			\n	0.55%	0.56%	n=4\n			0.21%\n \n0.0\n \nPlacebo <2 mg/kg 2 mg/kg 4 mg/kg 6-12 mg/kg 16 mg/kg 32 mg/kg\nN:† 544 294 894 1921 191 97 90\nSugammadex\n \nFig. 1.

The 3 subjects with exposures to multiple dose levels of sugammadex were counted in the higher dose group. None of the 9 cases of hypersensitivity occurred in any of these 3 subjects.\n \n71\n \nK.C. Min et al.	Journal of Clinical Anesthesia 47 (2018) 67–73\n \n\n \nmanaged with methods readily available in the operating room setting. Due to incomplete information in the setting of post-marketing data collection, these reports cannot be formally classiﬁed according to their severity; however, most described prompt recovery of aﬀected patients.\nFinally, the incidence of spontaneous reports of anaphylaxis was similar to that generally observed in the perioperative setting in which NMBAs had been administered. The epidemiologic literature suggests that the background rate of anaphylaxis (i.e., allergic and non-allergic anaphylaxis, or anaphylactoid reactions) in surgical patients receiving NMBA is approximately 15 to 34 conﬁrmed cases per 100,000 opera-tions, corresponding to a risk of 0.015% to 0.034% [21–24]. To the extent that anaphylaxis associated with sugammadex administration does occur, it takes place in a setting where the tools needed to eﬀec-tively manage the event are readily available, including a sub-specia-lized medical staﬀ who can respond to the situation without delay. These risks have also been mitigated by appropriate labeling to ensure that physicians are aware of and prepared to respond to the possibility of a hypersensitivity reaction with the use of sugammadex [25].\nThis study had several notable strengths. The population represents the largest number of subjects in controlled clinical trials evaluated to date for hypersensitivity reactions associated with the use of su-gammadex. In addition, an independent AC was used to adjudicate all potential events of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis, with AC members strictly blinded to treatment assignment. Finally, three sepa-rate analytic methods and a comprehensive review of post-marketing reports were used to capture potential hypersensitivity reactions. Each of these methods consistently revealed a low incidence of hypersensi-tivity reactions associated with sugammadex, permitting a high level of conﬁdence in these results.\nThis analysis also had several limitations. Given the low incidence of hypersensitivity and the absence of any cases of anaphylaxis in the clinical trials of anesthetized healthy subjects and surgical patients, a larger study would be required to provide an estimate of the incidence of anaphylaxis in the surgical population. Furthermore, due to the retrospective nature of this study, assessment of skin reactions, tryptase, or other measures to further characterize the cases of hypersensitivity were not conducted. Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions typi-cally present as a combination of clinical symptoms, whereby temporal aspects are of key importance (i.e., certain symptoms typically occur either simultaneously or chronologically, but at least in a close order). Whereas automated MedDRA searches are able to identify multiple symptoms (e.g., the algorithmic search), they typically do not account for the speciﬁc temporal aspects of hypersensitivity; rather, events are counted even if symptoms occurred several days apart. Additionally, the surgical setting confounds automated selection of a broad scope of events. For instance, coughing is a common AE that occurs immediately after surgery, but it is typically related to intubation rather than to hypersensitivity. Other non-speciﬁc AEs that are common in the peri-operative setting include nausea, vomiting, rashes, and blood pressure changes, complicating the interpretation of potential signs and symp-toms of hypersensitivity. Several other agents known to induce hy-persensitivity reactions are also extensively used in this setting (e.g., NMBAs, opioids, antibiotics, latex), and may also confound ﬁndings. Retrospective adjudication of events poses limitations in that, for ad-judication of potential hypersensitivity events, it is not possible to query the investigator for additional information or perform laboratory or other tests that may have assisted in adjudication since the studies are closed. In addition, the post-marketing analysis is further limited by the spontaneous nature of the reporting, which includes heterogeneity in the level of clinical information provided. To acknowledge those lim-itations, the “Unable to Adjudicate” category was included as an ad-judication category for cases in which information was too limited for the adjudicators to render a determination as to whether it was a case of hypersensitivity related to study drug. However, in the analysis of post-marketing cases, all reports of anaphylaxis were considered anaphylaxis regardless of the results of adjudication as a conservative approach to\nestimating the incidence of anaphylaxis.\nThe risks of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis with sugammadex were previously studied in two dedicated clinical trials conducted in non-anesthetized healthy volunteers [18]. The results demonstrated a higher incidence of hypersensitivity with sugammadex relative to pla-cebo. Clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity and/or anaphy-laxis occurred soon after sugammadex administration, generally within 10 min of bolus administration. The highest incidence of hypersensi-tivity occurred in the groups receiving the 16 mg/kg sugammadex dose, with 4 events of conﬁrmed anaphylaxis by the Sampson and/or Brighton criteria [16,17] within 1min after initial dosing out of 298 subjects across these two studies. The 16 mg/kg dose of sugammadex is recommended only when there is an urgent or emergent need to reverse NMB following administration of rocuronium. In such cases, there would be a far greater beneﬁt associated with rapidly reversing NMB relative to the small risk for anaphylaxis. When present, the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity resolved quickly and spontaneously in the majority of cases, with the remainder of patients responding to treat-ment with antihistamines, corticosteroids and epinephrine. Im-portantly, the frequency or severity of hypersensitivity events did not increase after repeated dosing of sugammadex, suggesting no apparent sensitization with repeated administration.\n5. Conclusions\nAcross the sugammadex clinical development program, low in-cidences of suspected hypersensitivity were reported among surgical patients. Importantly, no anaphylaxis occurred in subjects receiving sugammadex 4mg/kg, the highest recommended dose for routine NMB reversal in clinical practice. Cumulative post-marketing, worldwide pharmacovigilance experience suggests that spontaneous hypersensi-tivity reactions with sugammadex are reported at rates similar to the background incidence of hypersensitivity reactions typically observed in the perioperative setting. During post-marketing use of sugammadex, spontaneous reports of anaphylaxis were rare, and events were eﬀec-tively managed with standard treatment within the highly-monitored setting of the operating room. Taken together, these data suggest that although there is a risk for hypersensitivity reactions related to su-gammadex administration, only a small subset of such events can be classiﬁed as anaphylaxis. In the context of these ﬁndings, the risk for anaphylaxis related to sugammadex administration appears to be lim-ited and manageable, with appropriate communication of this risk via product labelling to providers and patients.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2018.03.018.\nAuthor contributions\nK.

Secondary endpoint of anaphylaxis was classiﬁed per Sampson and Brighton criteria. Exploratory endpoints included skin testing, serum tryptase, anti-sugammadex antibodies [immunoglobulin (Ig) E/IgG], and other immunologic parameters.\nResults: Hypersensitivity was adjudicated for 1/148 (0.7%), 7/150 (4.7%), and 0/150 (0.0%) subjects after sugammadex\n 1  1  1\n4mgkg ,16mgkg , and placebo, respectively. After sugammadex 16 mg kg , one subject met Sampson criterion 1 and Brighton level 1 (highest certainty) anaphylaxis criteria; two met Brighton level 2 criteria. After database lock it was determined that certain protocol deviations could have introduced bias in the reporting of hypersensitivity signs/ symptoms in a subject subset. Objective laboratory investigations indicated that potential underlying hypersensitivity mechanisms were unlikely to have been activated; the results suggest that most of the observed hypersensitivity\nreactions were unlikely IgE/IgG-mediated.\n \nEditorial decision: 24 May 2018; Accepted: 24 May 2018\n \n© 2018 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

Laboratory investigations do not suggest prevalent allergen-speciﬁc IgE/IgG-mediated immunologic hypersensitivity. Because it could not be fully excluded that estimates of hyper-sensitivity/anaphylaxis incidence were unbiased, an additional study was conducted to characterise the potential for hypersensitivity reactions and is described in a companion report.\nClinical trial registration: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00988065; Protocol number P06042.\n \nKeywords: anaphylaxis; hypersensitivity; sugammadex\n \nEditor’s key points\n  Hypersensitivity in response to sugammadex admin-\nistration can occur, but it is not known whether or not\nthe incidence is dose-dependent.\n  In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 448\nhealthy volunteers were randomised to receive three\nrepeat i.v. administrations of either sugammadex\n 1  1\n4mgkg ,16mgkg , or placebo.\n  Hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis reactions to sugam-\nmadex were dose-dependent when sugammadex was\nadministered without previous administration of a\nneuromuscular blocking agent.\nDrug hypersensitivity is an uncommon, often unpredictable, and potentially serious medical problem in the operating room. With concomitant administration of multiple drugs, the culprit may be difﬁcult to identify. Furthermore, presentation is highly variable, and mechanisms behind drug hyper-sensitivity can be allergic or non-allergic.\nSugammadex is a cyclodextrin derivative approved for reversal of neuromuscular block (NMB) induced by rocuro-nium or vecuronium. Safety data collected from more than 50 clinical studies including more than 600 healthy volunteers and 3000 surgical patients, together with reports from general\n1,2 use, indicate that sugammadex is generally well tolerated. However, a low incidence of suspected hypersensitivity has been observed in studies on non-anaesthetised healthy vol-\n3,4\nunteers and surgical patients. The events in these studies were reported as not severe nor serious, and were self-limiting. Hypersensitivity events and rare reports of anaphy-laxis/anaphylactic shock have been reported in clinical, post-market use; these were generally manageable in the oper-\n5e12\nating room, with rates conservatively estimated as com-parable with background incidence in the perioperative setting.\nTherefore, this study was conducted to better understand speciﬁc signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity in the absence of potentially confounding factors present under operating room conditions during surgery and to inform on the potential of sugammadex to induce hypersensitivity at different doses\n 1  1 [4 mg kg (highest routine reversal dose) or 16 mg kg (recommended dose for immediate reversal in emergency situations)] and with sequential exposure, relative to placebo. The underlying mechanism of any hypersensitivity reaction was further explored.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre study (Protocol number P06042; ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT00988065) was conducted in healthy volunteers at four centres in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA between August 24, 2009 and April 13, 2010 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). Written informed consent was obtained from all participating sub-jects. The study was conducted in accordance with principles of Good Clinical Practice and approved by appropriate insti-tutional review boards and regulatory agencies.\nAll subjects received single-blind placebo on Day 1. Sub-jects without suspect hypersensitivity signs/symptoms were randomised 1:1:1 on Day 8 according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule (prepared for each clinical site sepa-rately, with each subject assigned a unique randomised\n 1 number) to treatment with sugammadex 4 mg kg ,\n 1\n16 mg kg , or placebo (normal saline). Subjects received three repeat double-blind i.v. bolus administrations (one injection per dose period) of their assigned treatment during Weeks 1, 5, and 11. A follow-up visit was scheduled 1 week later (Week 12). Administrations were spaced  4 weeks apart to allow sufﬁ-cient time for sensitisation to occur should the hypersensi-tivity signs/symptoms be secondary to sugammadex-induced immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Blinding was to be maintained by covering syringes so that the light colour difference between sugammadex and placebo was not revealed; the investigator evaluating adverse events was not to be involved in study drug administration.\nStudy subjects\nNon-pregnant, non-breastfeeding healthy subjects aged 18e55 yr were included. Exclusion criteria are listed in Supplementary Material.\nHypersensitivity/anaphylaxis adjudication\nSuspected hypersensitivity signs/symptoms were systemati-cally scored by the investigator based on a pre-determined list, which could be extended as needed (Supplementary Material, Table S1), and submitted to an independent blinded external Adjudication Committee (AC). The AC assessed whether the constellation of signs/symptoms could be classiﬁed as hyper-sensitivity while blinded to subject, visit number, and treat-ment. If a hypersensitivity reaction was conﬁrmed, the AC\n \n760 - de Kam et al.\n \nassessed whether it fulﬁlled anaphylaxis criteria as described\n13\nby Sampson and colleagues criterion 1, by the Brighton\n14\nCollaboration Anaphylaxis Working Group, or both (Table 1). The Sampson criteria for anaphylaxis were determined by a meeting of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network; these criteria are generally accepted as the deﬁnition of anaphylaxis. The Sampson criterion 1 is limited to reactions in which the affected subject is not known to be allergic to the potential\n13\nallergen. The Brighton Collaboration Anaphylaxis Working Group also deﬁned anaphylaxis, taking the approach of using a list of deﬁned terms of major and minor criteria with a scoring system and three levels of diagnostic certainty with a focus on analysis of patient records, with level 1 representing the highest level of anaphylaxis certainty. Both methods were used in this study to ensure all potential cases of anaphylaxis would be identiﬁed.\nSafety endpoints\nadjudicated anaphylaxis according to Sampson criteria (Table 1). Other safety parameters included number/percent-age of subjects by level ofcertainty of anaphylaxis according to Brighton criteria, and changes over time in frequency/severity of adjudicated hypersensitivity symptoms by study drug administration. All subjects were admitted to Phase 1 research units for monitoring during the study. Investigators were trained in recognising and recording hypersensitivity signs/ symptoms and instructed on how to act in the event of severe hypersensitivity signs/symptoms. To ensure subject safety, full resuscitative equipment and rescue treatment, including epinephrine and antihistamine, were available at each participating study centre during the trial. Additional safety assessments included repeated assessment of vital signs, ECGs, adverse events (including hypersensitivity symptoms), physical examination, haematology, and blood chemistry ex-aminations, including tryptase. An external Data Safety Monitoring Committee reviewed data, monitoring subject safety during the conduct of the study.\n \nThe primary safety endpoint was the number/percentage of\nPost-study review of protocol deviations\nsubjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity signs/symptoms\nfor each study drug administration. The key secondary After database lock and study completion, it was determined endpoint was the number/percentage of subjects with that certain protocol deviations could have introduced bias\n \nTable 1 Scoring of anaphylaxis according to the Sampson13 and Brighton criteria.14\nFor the purposes of adjudication, sugammadex was\nnot considered a known or likely allergen for a healthy subject and categories 2 and 3 of the Sampson deﬁnition of anaphylaxis (not\nshown in table) were not considered applicable according to the Adjudication Committee.

Disposition of subjects. Of 10 subjects who discontinued treatment after experiencing suspected hypersensitivity signs/symptoms,\nseven were from the sugammadex 16 mg kg 1 group (six of the seven subjects had adjudicated hypersensitivity), two were from the\nsugammadex 4 mg kg 1 group (neither of these two subjects had adjudicated hypersensitivity), and one was from the placebo group (this\nsubject did not have adjudicated hypersensitivity).\n \ninto the reporting of hypersensitivity signs/symptoms in a subset of subjects. Subsequently, an extensive review of documentation was undertaken at all study sites revealing that most of the protocol deviations mainly involved docu-mentation issues and were generally assessed as likely to have little impact upon the primary study results. However, there were deviations which had the potential to affect blinding of safety assessors and thereby introduce bias in the collection of hypersensitivity signs, symptoms, or both in a subset of sub-jects: (i) at one site with 129 subjects, some staff members who assisted the pharmacist with the preparation of blinded medication doses also interacted with subjects in the acqui-sition of vital signs and adverse events; (ii) for 199 subjects, the safety assessor was not different from the person adminis-tering the study drug, although the study drug was adminis-tered using a masked syringe. These deviations were unlikely to affect the objectively measured exploratory biomarkers in the identiﬁed cases of hypersensitivity.\nGiven the number of cases involved, an additional dedi-cated hypersensitivity study was conducted (www. clinicaltrials.gov NCT02028065), described in an accompa-nying manuscript, to characterise the incidence and potential for sugammadex to induce hypersensitivity reaction.\nExploratory mechanistic research\nTryptase\nTryptase concentrations were measured in subjects with suspected hypersensitivity to help assess mast cell response and activation. Blood sampling was performed before dosing and 1 h after administration of study drug, at screening and\nthe follow-up visit. For subjects with suspected hypersensi-tivity signs/symptoms, additional blood samples were collected 3, 6, and 24 h after onset of suspected event. Tryptase was measured by the Phadia UniCAP assay (Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (reference values for healthy subjects: geo-\n 1 mg metric mean of 3.8 mgl and upper 95th percentile of 11.4  1\nl ). Quest Diagnostics (San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA) was used as the central laboratory.\nAnti-sugammadex antibodies\nA sugammadex-speciﬁc antibody assay was developed (Supplementary Material, Methods). Samples were collected before each administration of study drug and 24 h, 14 days, and 28 days after onset of signs/symptoms. Samples were centrally analysed for subjects with adjudicated hypersensi-tivity, and for a subset of 94 subjects without suspected hypersensitivity signs/symptoms.\nSkin testing\nSkin-prick testing (SPT) and intradermal testing (IDT) were performed in triplicate for subjects with adjudicated hyper-sensitivity signs/symptoms. Skin reactivity was assessed using negative (saline) and positive (histamine) controls. For\n 1 SPT, ascending concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mg ml\nsugammadex were applied. IDT used ascending concentra-\n 1\ntions of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg ml sugammadex; IDT was administered to subjects with no response to sugammadex SPT. Skin tests were performed approximately 4e6 weeks after sugammadex exposure. The ﬁrst 175 subjects without\n \n762 - de Kam et al.\n \nhypersensitivity signs/symptoms were skin tested after	the	incidence of subjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity\nﬁrst administration.

For\n		other safety parameters, data were summarised using\n		descriptive statistics.\nBasophil histamine release		\n \n\n \nBasophil histamine release testing was performed by RefLab ApS (Copenhagen, Denmark), as previously described\n15\n(Supplementary Material, Methods), for subjects with adju-dicated hypersensitivity and an equal number of age-, sex-, and clinical site-matched subjects without adjudicated hypersensitivity.\nAdditional exploratory mechanistic endpoints\nBlood samples for additional assessment of potential hyper-sensitivity mechanisms were obtained pre-dose, 2 and 10 min, and 1, 3, and 6 h after dosing of study medication for all sub-jects and additionally 24 h, 14 days, and 28 days after onset of signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity (Supplementary Material, Methods).\nResults\nPatient disposition and baseline characteristics In total, 480 subjects received single-blind placebo on Day 1 (Fig. 1); 448 were randomised. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (Table 2). Overall, 397 (89%) rando-mised subjects received their three scheduled administrations of study drug and completed the Week 12 follow-up visit. More\n 1\nsubjects in the sugammadex 16 mg kg treatment group discontinued because of adverse events compared with those\n 1\nin the placebo and sugammadex 4 mg kg treatment groups.\n \nHypersensitivity analysis\n \nStatistical analysis	Placebo treatment group\n \n\n \nA sample size of 450 randomised subjects (150 per treatment arm) was considered sufﬁcient to obtain an indication of the number/percentage of subjects with adjudicated hypersensi-tivity/anaphylaxis symptoms, resulting in half-width of 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for a single group of 2.2e4.8% if the empirical percentages of subjects with hypersensitivity symptoms were between 2% and 10%.\nAnalysis was performed for the all-subjects-treated group, which comprised all subjects who were randomised and subsequently received blinded study medication. For the primary and key secondary safety endpoints, the percentage (95% CI) of subjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity symp-toms was calculated by treatment group. For each of the two sugammadex doses, the difference vs placebo in overall\nNo subject in the placebo group had adjudicated hypersensitivity.\n 1\nSugammadex 4 mg kg treatment group\nHypersensitivity was adjudicated for one (0.7%) subject who experienced moderate, mild-to-moderate, and no hypersensi-tivity symptoms after the ﬁrst, second, and third administra-tion, respectively (Fig. 2a). All observed signs appeared within 10 min of sugammadex administration and resolved within 5 h without treatment. Compared with placebo, the mean (95% CI) difference in rate of subjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity\n 1\nafter sugammadex 4 mg kg was 0.7% (e1.8, 3.7%).\n \nTable 2 Summary of patient and baseline characteristics within and across treatment groups.

Occurrence of adjudicated hypersensitivity events and timing of events after treatment with (A) sugammadex 4 mg kg 1 and (B)\nsugammadex 16 mg kg 1.\nSubjects with no adjudicated hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis are presented ﬁrst. Each subject with hypersen-\nsitivity, anaphylaxis, or both is then represented by a separate horizontal line. : no hypersensitivity; : adjudicated hypersensitivity\nwith no evidence of anaphylaxis; : adjudicated hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis according to Brighton (level 2) criteria only;\n: adjudicated hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis according to both Sampson and Brighton (level 1) criteria.\n \n 1\nSugammadex 16•mg kg treatment group\nHypersensitivity was adjudicated for seven (4.7%) subjects (Fig. 2b), all of whom experienced dermatological symptoms, and with four experiencing hypersensitivity signs/symptoms related to other organ classes. Most of the observed signs\n 1 appeared within 5 min after sugammadex 16 mg kg administration, were of mild/moderate intensity, and resolved within 5 h without treatment. Compared with placebo, the\nmean (95% CI) difference in rate of subjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity was 4.7% (2.1, 9.3%).\nSix of the seven subjects experienced hypersensitivity after the ﬁrst sugammadex administration; one subject proceeded to receive a second and third administration of sugammadex\n 1\n16 mg kg , and mild hypersensitivity symptoms occurred after each administration. The seventh subject had adjudi-cated hypersensitivity after the second administration, and discontinued treatment thereafter (Fig. 2b).\n \n764 - de Kam et al.\n \nOne subject, a 55-yr-old white female, had hypersensitivity\n13\nsymptoms which met the Sampson criteria (key secondary endpoint) for anaphylaxis, according to the AC, and the sec-\n14\nondary Level 1 Brighton criteria (i.e. highest certainty). This event occurred within minutes after the ﬁrst sugammadex\n 1\n16 mg kg administration. Symptoms included severe non-pruritic generalised urticaria, severe ﬂushing, moderate\n 1\ntachycardia (HR 149 beats min 3 min post-administration, vs\n 1\nmedian 82 beats min pre-administration), hypotension (67/42 mm Hg at 18 min post-administration, vs median 113/77 mm Hg pre-administration), severe nausea with vomiting, mild muscle spasms of the back, and mild numbness of the lips. S.C. epinephrine was administered 10 min after sugam-madex and diphenhydramine was administered 8 min later for persistent hypotension. Nineteen minutes after the initial sugammadex administration, BP returned to normal (116/72 mm Hg). All other hypersensitivity signs/symptoms resolved the same day, although the subject continued to have mild, intermittent headaches, which resolved after 6 weeks without treatment, and were considered unrelated to sugammadex.\nTwo subjects had one event each after the ﬁrst adminis-\n 1\ntration of sugammadex 16 mg kg adjudicated as meeting the Brighton criteria for anaphylaxis with lower certainty (i.e. level 2); neither met the Sampson criteria for anaphylaxis. The underlying hypersensitivity symptoms were mild (dysgeusia, persistent dry cough, generalised urticaria) for one and mod-erate (ﬂushing, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, generalised urticaria, ronchi) for the other; they resolved without treatment.\nCompared with placebo, the mean (95% CI) difference in subjects meeting Sampson criteria for anaphylaxis was 0.7% (e1.8, 3.7%), and meeting the Brighton criteria of combined level 1 or 2 diagnostic certainty was 2.0% (e0.5, 5.7%) after\n 1\nsugammadex 16 mg kg .\nAdverse events\nTreatment-related adverse events were reported in nine (6.0%), 16 (10.8%), and 56 (37.3%) subjects in the placebo,\n 1  1\nsugammadex 4 mg kg , and 16 mg kg treatment groups, respectively. Adverse events of reported severe intensity were reported in one (0.7%), one (0.7%), and four (2.7%) patients in\n 1  1 the placebo, sugammadex 4 mg kg , and 16 mg kg groups, respectively.\nMechanistic analysis\nAnti-sugammadex antibodies\nOf the eight subjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity, two showed reactivity in the anti-sugammadex screening and conﬁrmatory assay. Both subjects tested negative in the spe-ciﬁc anti-sugammadex IgG and IgE assays (Supplementary Material, Results).\nOf 94 control subjects (without hypersensitivity signs/ symptoms), ﬁve (5.3%) had positive screening and conﬁrma-tory assays for pre-administration samples (sugammadex, n¼2; placebo, n¼3). While four subjects tested negative for anti-sugammadex IgG and IgE, one subject tested positive for anti-sugammadex IgG in samples obtained on Days 1, 7 (pre-sugammadex administration), 35, and 77, and negative for IgE. This subject did not show any clinical signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity, and had no prior sugammadex exposure.\nSkin testing\nUpon testing, seven of the eight subjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity met the pre-deﬁned criteria for the positive and negative controls for SPT; all had negative SPT to all sugammadex concentrations.\nFive of the eight subjects met the pre-deﬁned criteria for positive and negative controls for IDT; one subject (who experienced anaphylaxis according to both the Sampson and\n 1\nBrighton criteria in the sugammadex 16 mg kg group) had a positive IDT in triplicate at the maximum test concentration of\n 1\n10 mg ml only.\nBoth the SPT and IDT results in the 161 subjects without adjudicated hypersensitivity and with skin-test results showed high speciﬁcity (>99%); only one subject receiving\n 1\nsugammadex 4 mg kg had a positive SPT (sugammadex di-\n 1  1\nlutions 1 mg ml and 0.1 mg ml ) and one subject in the placebo group had a positive IDT (sugammadex dilutions\n 1  1\n0.1 mg ml and 0.01 mg ml ).\nAdditional hypersensitivity mechanistic empirical analysis No meaningful differences between subjects with and without adjudicated hypersensitivity were observed in additional mechanistic tests (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThis study suggests a risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) with sugammadex in conscious healthy volunteers who have not been anaesthetised or administered a neuromuscular blocking agent. After sugam-\n 1\nmadex 4 mg kg , the highest recommended dose for routine reversal of neuromuscular block, one subject experienced adjudicated hypersensitivity, and there were no cases of adjudicated anaphylaxis. Seven subjects experienced adjudi-\n 1\ncated hypersensitivity with sugammadex 16 mg kg , a dose recommended only for potentially life-threatening emergency situations during which rapid reversal of neuromuscular block is deemed necessary. Most of the adjudicated hypersensitivity signs/symptoms reported in this study started within 5 min of sugammadex administration, were of mild-to-moderate in-tensity, and resolved without medical intervention. The inci-dence of hypersensitivity reactions did not increase after repeated sugammadex exposure with doses administered at least 4 weeks apart, a regimen selected to optimise priming of\n 1 the immune system. After administration of the 16 mg kg\ndose, one subject met the predeﬁned primary endpoint for\n13\nanaphylaxis (Sampson criteria ); this subject responded well to medical management. Two other subjects met criteria (Brighton, level 2) for anaphylaxis after sugammadex\n 1\n16 mg kg ; their symptoms resolved without treatment.\nSubsequent to database lock and study completion, review of study source data from all sites revealed multiple protocol deviations. For a subset of subjects, those protocol deviations may have introduced bias in reporting of hypersensitivity signs/symptoms. As a result, the primary and secondary endpoints of incidences of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis conﬁrmed by adjudication may not accurately reﬂect the true incidences. A second dedicated study to characterise the po-tential for sugammadex to induce hypersensitivity reactions in healthy volunteers was conducted (study P101; www. clinicaltrials.gov NCT02028065).\n \nExploration of sugammadex hypersensitivity - 765\n \nTable 3 Summary of mechanistic hypersensitivity research (subjects [n¼8] with adjudicated hypersensitivity only). *Basophil hista-\nmine release testing was performed in three parts: using the subject’s washed white blood cells (WBCs) containing intact basophils;\nusing the subject’s washed WBCs containing IgE-stripped basophils; and using donor (from blood bank) washed WBCs containing\nintact basophils treated with sera from these same subjects (passive sensitisation).

These are unlikely to have been affected by the identi-ﬁed protocol deviations and are considered informative regarding the underlying mechanism(s), especially as clinical manifestations may be more severe in patients with docu-mented immunologic hypersensitivity reactions than in sub-\n17,18 jects presenting with a non-immunologic reaction. In this study, no sugammadex-speciﬁc IgE antibodies were found in the serum of any subject with adjudicated hypersensitivity, or in the subset of (n¼94) subjects tested without hypersensitiv-ity, despite repeated sugammadex exposure.\nSkin testing, a method presumed to assess allergen-speciﬁc IgE mediated degranulation of mast cells, is the pre-sent ‘gold standard’ widely used in the diagnosis of IgE-\n18,19\nmediated allergy. Results must be interpreted in clinical context and ideally with a well-characterised non-irritant\n20\nextract. There are no large studies determining non-irritant\n21\nconcentrations of sugammadex in the literature. In the current study, 159 of 161 subjects without adjudicated hy-persensitivity and seven of the eight subjects with adjudi-cated hypersensitivity had negative SPT results. One subject (of ﬁve with adjudicated hypersensitivity and adequate re-sponses to IDT controls) had a positive IDT result at the\n 1\nmaximum concentration of 10 mg ml only. Interestingly, this subject was classiﬁed with anaphylaxis (Sampson and\n 1\nBrighton criteria), after sugammadex 16 mg kg . However, this single positive IDT may not reﬂect an IgE response, as the subject tested negative for serum anti-sugammadex IgE/IgG antibodies. Moreover, basophil histamine release and tryp-tase values were within normal limits without signiﬁcant increase from baseline and it is possible that a concentration\n 1\nas high as 10 mg ml may have a direct local effect. Results of mechanistic testing in this individual, together with the overall low frequency of positive skin-testing, further\nsupport the absence of drug-speciﬁc IgE antibodies in sub-jects with adjudicated hypersensitivity. Hence, skin-testing did not appear to be of signiﬁcant value in the diagnosis or prediction of most hypersensitivity to sugammadex in this study. Serological data reported here concur with studies in rabbits, indicating very weak immunogenicity (Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, data on ﬁle).\nAssessment of tryptase concentrations can be helpful in evaluating underlying mechanisms of hypersensitivity signs/\n22e26\nsymptoms. All subjects with adjudicated hypersensitivity had tryptase values within the normal range, with no relevant changes from baseline observed post-sugammadex, even in the single subject with anaphylaxis. These results are in line\n5\nwith an anaphylactic case report, and the follow-updedicated sugammadex hypersensitivity study (P101; www.clinicaltrials. gov NCT02028065).\nNo signiﬁcant histamine release was observed post-challenge by basophils isolated from subjects with adjudi-cated hypersensitivity. Results from a broader exploratory evaluation of biomarkers to assess contact and complement activation, neutrophil activation, and levels of inﬂammatory cytokines do not suggest a role for these processes or media-tors in the hypersensitivity signs/symptoms after sugamma-dex administration.\nIn the wider sugammadex clinical development pro-gramme, suspected cases of hypersensitivity after adminis-tration of high doses of sugammadex (above those approved for immediate reversal of neuromuscular block in an emer-\n 1\ngency situation, i.e. exceeding 16 mg kg )have been observed;\n4 all cases were self-limiting and did not require treatment. Tryptase concentrations and skin testing were performed on one patient who experienced paraesthesia in the skin of hands and face, blurred vision of moderate intensity, dysgeusia, nausea, tachycardia, and stomach discomfort after sugam-\n 1  1\nmadex infusion of 8.4 mg kg of a 32 mg kg dose; skin\n \n766 - de Kam et al.\n \nﬂushing and an abdominal erythematous rash subsequently\n4\noccurred. Elevated tryptase concentrations were seen at 1 and 3 h post-dose, and positive IDT results at a 1:1000 dilution of\n 1 4\nsugammadex 100 mg ml . However, no IgE antibodies could be detected in blood samples from this patient collected approximately 1.5 yr after sugammadex exposure. In addition, there have been occasional case reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis at lower doses of sugammadex (1.8e3.3 mg\n 1 5e12\nkg ). Positive skin test reactions were observed in some of these cases, with variable tryptase and histamine concentra-tion results. In general, onset of symptoms occurred within 5 min of sugammadex administration.\nThe exploratory mechanistic research of hypersensitivity reactions detected in this study neither support an IgE/IgG-mediated immunologic hypersensitivity mechanism nor afﬁrm direct basophil/mast cell degranulation or mechanisms related to contact/complement activation or acute inﬂamma-tion. Skin-testing or measuring serum anti-sugammadex an-tibodies appear unlikely to identify individuals at risk for anaphylaxis. Regardless of the exact underlying mechanism, physicians should monitor for hypersensitivity symptoms af-ter sugammadex administration and be prepared to treat with standard measures for hypersensitivity in the perioperative setting, where sugammadex is intended for use.\nAppendix A.

However, these drugs have signiﬁcant limitations, such as indirect mechanisms of reversal, limited and unpredictable\nefﬁcacy, and undesirable autonomic responses. Sugammadex is a selective relaxant-binding agent speciﬁcally developed for rapid reversal\nof non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium. Its potential clinical beneﬁts include fast and predictable reversal\nof any degree of block, increased patient safety, reduced incidence of residual block on recovery, and more efﬁcient use of healthcare\nresources.\nObjectives\nThe main objective of this review was to compare the efﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular\nblockade caused by non-depolarizing neuromuscular agents in adults.\nSearch methods\nWe searched the following databases on 2 May 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE\n(WebSPIRS Ovid SP), Embase (WebSPIRS Ovid SP), and the clinical trials registries www.controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and\nwww.centerwatch.com. We re-ran the search on 10 May 2017.\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes\npublished, or language. We included adults, classiﬁed as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I to IV, who received non-\ndepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents for an elective in-patient or day-case surgical procedure. We included all trials comparing\nsugammadex versus neostigmine that reported recovery times or adverse events. We included any dose of sugammadex and neostigmine\nand any time point of study drug administration.\nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review) 1\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to identify trials for eligibility, examined articles for eligibility, abstracted\ndata, assessed the articles, and excluded obviously irrelevant reports. We resolved disagreements by discussion between review authors\nand further disagreements through consultation with the last review author. We assessed risk of bias in 10 methodological domains\nusing the Cochrane risk of bias tool and examined risk of random error through trial sequential analysis. We used the principles of the\nGRADE approach to prepare an overall assessment of the quality of evidence. For our primary outcomes (recovery times to train-of-\nfour ratio (TOFR) > 0.9), we presented data as mean differences (MDs) with 95 % conﬁdence intervals (CIs), and for our secondary\noutcomes (risk of adverse events and risk of serious adverse events), we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with CIs.\nMain results\nWe included 41 studies (4206 participants) in this updated review, 38 of which were new studies. Twelve trials were eligible for meta-\nanalysis of primary outcomes (n = 949), 28 trials were eligible for meta-analysis of secondary outcomes (n = 2298), and 10 trials (n =\n1647) were ineligible for meta-analysis.\nWe compared sugammadex 2 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg for reversal of rocuronium-induced moderate neuromuscular blockade\n(NMB). Sugammadex 2 mg/kg was 10.22 minutes (6.6 times) faster then neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (1.96 vs 12.87 minutes) in reversing\nNMB from the second twitch (T2) to TOFR > 0.9 (MD 10.22 minutes, 95% CI 8.48 to 11.96; I2 = 84%; 10 studies, n = 835;\nGRADE: moderate quality).\nWe compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg for reversal of rocuronium-induced deep NMB. Sugammadex 4\nmg/kg was 45.78 minutes (16.8 times) faster then neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (2.9 vs 48.8 minutes) in reversing NMB from post-tetanic\ncount (PTC) 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9 (MD 45.78 minutes, 95% CI 39.41 to 52.15; I2 = 0%; two studies, n = 114; GRADE: low quality).\nFor our secondary outcomes, we compared sugammadex, any dose, and neostigmine, any dose, looking at risk of adverse and serious\nadverse events. We found signiﬁcantly fewer composite adverse events in the sugammadex group compared with the neostigmine group\n(RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.74; I2 = 40%; 28 studies, n = 2298; GRADE: moderate quality). Risk of adverse events was 28% in the\nneostigmine group and 16% in the sugammadex group, resulting in a number needed to treat for an additional beneﬁcial outcome\n(NNTB) of 8. When looking at speciﬁc adverse events, we noted signiﬁcantly less risk of bradycardia (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34; I\n2\n\n= 0%; 11 studies, n = 1218; NNTB 14; GRADE: moderate quality), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (RR 0.52, 95% CI\n0.28 to 0.97; I2 = 0%; six studies, n = 389; NNTB 16; GRADE: low quality) and overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis (RR\n0.40, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.57; I2 = 0%; 15 studies, n = 1474; NNTB 13; GRADE: moderate quality) in the sugammadex group when\ncompared with the neostigmine group. Finally, we found no signiﬁcant differences between sugammadex and neostigmine regarding\nrisk of serious adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.25; I2= 0%; 10 studies, n = 959; GRADE: low quality).\nApplication of trial sequential analysis (TSA) indicates superiority of sugammadex for outcomes such as recovery time from T2 to\nTOFR > 0.9, adverse events, and overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis.\nAuthors’ conclusions\nReview results suggest that in comparison with neostigmine, sugammadex can more rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced neuromus-\ncular block regardless of the depth of the block. Sugammadex 2 mg/kg is 10.22 minutes (~ 6.6 times) faster in reversing moderate\nneuromuscular blockade (T2) than neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (GRADE: moderate quality), and sugammadex 4 mg/kg is 45.78 minutes\n(~ 16.8 times) faster in reversing deep neuromuscular blockade (PTC 1 to 5) than neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (GRADE: low quality).\nWith an NNTB of 8 to avoid an adverse event, sugammadex appears to have a better safety proﬁle than neostigmine. Patients receiving\nsugammadex had 40% fewer adverse events compared with those given neostigmine. Speciﬁcally, risks of bradycardia (RR 0.16, NNTB\n14; GRADE: moderate quality), PONV (RR 0.52, NNTB 16; GRADE: low quality), and overall signs of postoperative residual\nparalysis (RR 0.40, NNTB 13; GRADE: moderate quality) were reduced. Both sugammadex and neostigmine were associated with\nserious adverse events in less than 1% of patients, and data showed no differences in risk of serious adverse events between groups (RR\n0.54; GRADE: low quality).\n', 'Cochrane Databaseof SystematicReviews\n\nEfficacy andsafety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade inadults (Review)\n\nHristovska AM,Duch P,Allingstrup M,Afshari A\n\nHristovska AM, Duch P,Allingstrup M, Afshari A.\nEfficacy and safetyof sugammadexversus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockadein adults.\nCochraneDatabaseofSystematicReviews 2017, Issue8.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nA B S T R A C T\n\nBackground\n\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine, have traditionally been used for reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. However, these drugs have signiﬁcant limitations, such as indirect mechanisms of reversal, limited and unpredictable efﬁcacy,andundesirableautonomic responses.Sugammadex is aselectiverelaxant-binding agentspeciﬁcallydevelopedforrapidreversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium. Its potential clinical beneﬁts include fastand predictable reversal of any degree of block, increased patient safety, reduced incidence of residual block on recovery, and more efﬁcient use of healthcare resources.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe main objective of thisreview was to compare theefﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versusneostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade caused by non-depolarizing neuromuscular agents in adults.\n\nSearch methods\n\nWe searched the following databases on 2 May 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (WebSPIRS Ovid SP), Embase (WebSPIRS Ovid SP), and theclinical trials registries www.controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and www.centerwatch.com. We re-ran the search on 10 May 2017.\n\nSelection criteria\n\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes published, or language. We included adults, classiﬁed as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I to IV, who received non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents for an elective in-patient or day-case surgical procedure. We included all trials comparing sugammadex versusneostigmine thatreportedrecovery times or adverse events. We includedany dose of sugammadex and neostigmine and any time point of study drug administration.\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	1\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nTwo review authorsindependently screenedtitlesandabstracts toidentify trialsforeligibility, examinedarticlesfor eligibility, abstracted data, assessed the articles, and excluded obviously irrelevant reports. We resolved disagreements by discussion between review authors and further disagreements through consultation with the last review author. We assessed risk of bias in 10 methodological domains using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and examined risk of random error through trial sequential analysis. We used the principles of the GRADE approach to prepare an overall assessment of the quality of evidence. For our primary outcomes (recovery times to train-of-four ratio (TOFR) > 0.9), we presented data as mean differences (MDs) with 95 % conﬁdence intervals (CIs), and for our secondary outcomes (risk of adverse events and risk of serious adverse events), we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with CIs.\n\nMain results\n\nWe included 41 studies (4206 participants) in this updated review, 38 of which were new studies. Twelve trials were eligible for meta-analysis of primary outcomes (n = 949), 28 trials were eligible for meta-analysis of secondary outcomes (n = 2298), and 10 trials (n = 1647) were ineligible for meta-analysis.\n\nWecomparedsugammadex2mg/kgandneostigmine0.05mg/kgfor reversalofrocuronium-inducedmoderateneuromuscularblockade (NMB). Sugammadex 2 mg/kg was 10.22 minutes (6.6 times) faster thenneostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (1.96 vs 12.87 minutes) in reversing NMB from the second twitch (T2) to TOFR > 0.9 (MD 10.22 minutes, 95% CI 8.48 to 11.96; I2\n= 84%; 10 studies, n = 835; GRADE: moderate quality).\n\nWe compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg for reversal of rocuronium-induced deep NMB. Sugammadex 4 mg/kg was 45.78 minutes (16.8 times) faster then neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (2.9 vs 48.8 minutes) in reversing NMB from post-tetanic count (PTC) 1 to5 toTOFR >0.9 (MD 45.78 minutes, 95% CI39.41 to 52.15; I2\n=0%; two studies, n= 114; GRADE: low quality).\n\nFor our secondary outcomes, we compared sugammadex, any dose, and neostigmine, any dose, looking at risk of adverse and serious adverse events. We found signiﬁcantly fewer composite adverse events in thesugammadex group compared with the neostigmine group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.74; I2\n= 40%; 28 studies, n = 2298; GRADE: moderate quality). Risk of adverse events was 28% in the neostigmine group and 16% in the sugammadex group, resulting in a number needed to treat for an additional beneﬁcial outcome (NNTB) of 8. When looking at speciﬁc adverse events, we noted signiﬁcantly less risk of bradycardia (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34; I 2= 0%; 11 studies, n = 1218; NNTB 14; GRADE: moderate quality), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.97; I2\n= 0%; six studies, n = 389; NNTB 16; GRADE: low quality) and overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.57; I2\n= 0%; 15 studies, n = 1474; NNTB 13; GRADE: moderate quality) in the sugammadex group when compared with the neostigmine group. Finally, we found no signiﬁcant differences between sugammadex and neostigmine regarding risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.25; I2\n= 0%; 10 studies, n = 959; GRADE: low quality).\n\nApplication of trial sequential analysis (TSA) indicates superiority of sugammadex for outcomes such as recovery time from T2 to TOFR > 0.9, adverse events, and overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis.\n\nAuthors’ conclusions\n\nReview results suggest that in comparison with neostigmine, sugammadex can more rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced neuromus-cular block regardless of the depth of the block. Sugammadex 2 mg/kg is 10.22 minutes (~ 6.6 times) faster in reversing moderate neuromuscular blockade (T2) than neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (GRADE: moderate quality), and sugammadex 4 mg/kg is 45.78 minutes (~ 16.8 times) faster in reversing deep neuromuscular blockade (PTC 1 to 5) than neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (GRADE: low quality). With an NNTB of 8 to avoid an adverse event, sugammadex appears to have a better safety proﬁle than neostigmine. Patients receiving sugammadex had40% fewer adverse eventscompared with those given neostigmine. Speciﬁcally,risks of bradycardia (RR 0.16, NNTB 14; GRADE: moderate quality), PONV (RR 0.52, NNTB 16; GRADE: low quality), and overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis (RR 0.40, NNTB 13; GRADE: moderate quality) were reduced. Both sugammadex and neostigmine were associated with serious adverse events in less than 1% of patients, and data showed no differences in risk of serious adverse events between groups (RR 0.54; GRADE: low quality).\n\nP L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y\n\nBeneﬁts and harms of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing induced paralysis\n\nBackground\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	2\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	\n\nDifferent levels of induced paralysis are sometimes necessary when patients are put to sleep or are prepared for operations. When the operation is ﬁnished, paralysis should be reversed in a fast, reliable, and safe way. Neostigmine is a medication that is traditionally used to reverse induced paralysis. However, its use can be associated with incomplete or slow reversal as well as changes in lung function, heart function, and vomiting and nausea. Sugammadex is a relatively new medication speciﬁcally designed to reverse rocuronium-induced paralysis in a faster, more reliable, and safer way when compared with neostigmine.\n\nObjective\n\nThis review systematically sets out to compare the beneﬁts and harms of sugammadex and neostigmine. The evidence is current up to May 2017.\n\nStudy characteristics\n\nWe identiﬁed 41 randomized controlled trials comparing sugammadex with neostigmine that provided suitable data on efﬁcacy and safety. All of these trials included adults undergoing surgery and involved a total of 4206 participants.\n\nKey results\n\nData indicate that sugammadex was 10.22 minutes (6.6 times) faster than neostigmine (1.96 vs 12.87 minutes) in reversing moderate inducedparalysis.Sugammadexwas45.78minutes(16.8times) fasterthanneostigmine (2.9vs48.8minutes)inreversingdeepinduced paralysis. Participants receiving sugammadex appeared to have a 40% reduced risk of experiencing harmful events than those given neostigmine. Statistically, eight persons can be treated with sugammadex as opposed to neostigmine to avoid one person experiencing a single random harmful event. The occurrence of serious harmful events was nearly non-existent and data show no differences between compared groups.\n\nConclusion\nSugammadex is more efﬁcient and safer than neostigmine for reversing moderate and deep induced paralysis.\n\nQuality of evidence\nWe consider our overall ﬁndings on beneﬁts and harms to provide evidence of moderate quality in favour of sugammadex.\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	3\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Residual neuromuscular blockade may result in pulmonary com-plications, for example, laboured breathing, low oxygen levels in the blood, lung infection, and entry of gastric contents into the lungs (Berg 1997; Bevan 1996; Eriksson 1993; Eriksson 1997; Murphy 2006; Murphy 2008; Sundman 2000). It can also lead to a postoperative decrease in muscle strength with associated com-plications, such as visual difﬁculties and delayedrecovery and dis-charge time (Murphy 2011). Postoperative residual blockade fre-quently occurs after routine anaesthesia (Viby-Mogensen 1979). Its incidence varies among trials depending on the type of NMBA used. Some studies have demonstrated a lower incidence of resid-ual block following short-acting or intermediate-acting NMBAs in comparison with long-acting agents (Bevan 1988; Brull 1991). However,postoperativeresidualneuromuscularblockademay still occur in the short-acting or intermediate-acting NMBA group, with incidence ranging from 16% to 60% (Appelbaum 2003; Baillard 2005; Bevan 1996; Debaene 2003; Fawcett 1995; Hayes 2001; Kim 2002; Maybauer 2007; McCaul 2002).\nMonitoring of neuromuscular blockade\nThe degree of neuromuscular blockade is monitored by assess-ment of various patterns of electrical stimulation. The train-of-four (TOF) twitch stimulation was developed as a clinical tool that could be used to assess neuromuscular block in the anaes-thetized patient (Ali 1970). This strategy involves stimulating the ulnar nervewithfour supramaximal 200 microsecondstimulisep-aratedby0.5seconds. Thisapproach isrepeatedevery10seconds. Twitches on a TOF pattern fade as relaxation increases. This en-ables the observer to compare T1 (ﬁrst twitch of the TOF) versus T0 (control), as well as T4 (fourth twitch of the TOF) versus T1. This T1/T4 ratio is known as the TOF ratio (TOFR). Satisfac-tory recovery from neuromuscular block and clinical absence of residual curarization have not occurred until the TOFR is > 0.9 (Viby-Mogensen 2000), contrary to TOFR > 0.7, as previously suggested (Ali 1971). During profound non-depolarizing neuro-muscular block, no response to TOF twitch stimulation may oc-cur. In such circumstances, a post-tetanic count (PTC) may be useful (Viby-Mogensen 1981). If a 5 second tetanic stimulus at 50 Hz is administered, after no twitch response has been elicited, followed 3 seconds later by additional single twitches at 1 Hz, re-sponse to single twitch stimulation may occur. Although this pat-tern will not be seen during very profound block, a response will be seen in the early stages of recovery, before the TOF reappears. The number of post-tetanic twitches is an indication of when the ﬁrst twitch of the TOF will reappear.\nThe muscle response to peripheral nerve stimulation can be as-sessed by visual and tactile methods and by electromyography, acceleromyography, and mechanomyography. Visual observation and palpation of the contracting muscle group are the easiest\nbut least accurate methods of assessing neuromuscular block. Ac-celeromyography was introduced for clinical use in 1988 (Jensen 1988; Viby-Mogensen 1988). This technique measures accelera-tion of a distal digit, which is directly proportionate to the force of muscle contraction and therefore is inversely proportionate to the degree of neuromuscular block.\nThe monitor consists of an acceleration transducer (i.e. a piezo-electricceramic wafer with anelectrodeon each side) and astimu-lation and computing unit. The transducer can be fastened to the thumb, and when the ﬁnger is moved in response to nerve stim-ulation, a voltage difference develops between the two electrodes. The voltage then is measured and is registered in the computing unit.\nDescription of the intervention\nReversal of neuromuscular blockade\nThe most commonly used NMBA reversal agents are neostigmine and edrophonium, both of which are cholinesterase inhibitors. Theyantagonizebothaminosteroidalandcurariformtypesof non-depolarizing NMBAs by inhibiting the breakdown of ACh in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), causing, ACh to bind the recep-tor and depolarize the muscle ﬁbre and allowing greater transmis-sion of nerve impulses. These medications, however, require that a muscarinic antagonist (e.g. glycopyrrolate, atropine) be used to compensate for their cholinergic side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (Tramer1999).Adverseeffectsassociated withtheuseof muscarinic antagonists include tachycardia, dry mouth, and uri-nary retention (Mirakhur 1985).\nIn contrast to cholinesterase inhibitors, the NMBA reversal agent sugammadex does not interfere with acetylcholinesterase recep-tor systems; therefore, it does not produce the muscarinic side effects associated with other reversal medications for NMBAs. Sugammadex is a synthetically modiﬁed -cyclodextrin, a chem-ical structure with a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic core. It was speciﬁcally designed to reverse rocuronium-induced paralysis by encapsulating rocuronium; however, its inner cav-ity is large enough to encapsulate other aminosteroidal NMBAs such as vecuronium and, to a much lesser degree, pancuronium (Golembiewski 2016; Naguib 2009). Sugammadex does not bind nor does it reverse the neuromuscular blocking effects of curari-form NMBAs. Upon binding, it creates a complex formation be-tween the molecule and the aminosteroidal NMBA, which re-sults in more rapid reversal of the neuromuscular blockade than is achievedby anticholinesterase drugs (Park 2015). Sugammadex does not bind to plasma proteins and is not metabolized. It is ex-creted unchanged in the urine by the kidneys. Renal clearance of sugammadex is rapid - most of the dose (70%) is excreted within six hours (Golembiewski 2016).\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	9\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	\n\nHow the intervention might work\nThe positively charged quaternary nitrogen of the aminosteroidal NMBA forms electrostatic bonds with negatively charged interior groups of sugammadex to encapsulate rocuronium and vecuro-nium (Golembiewski 2016). Sugammadex forms a stable, inac-tive 1:1 complex with rocuronium or vecuronium; this reduces the amount of free NMBA that is available to bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in reversal of neuromuscular blockade (Keating 2016). Once the NMBA is removed from its site of action and is rendered inac-tive (by encapsulation within the sugammadex molecule in the plasma), neuromuscular transmission and muscle function are re-stored. By reversing aminosteroid-induced neuromuscular block-ade, one can avoid the associated risks caused by residual block, can shorten time in the operating room, and can improve the pa-tient’s quality of recovery and discharge time (Arbous 2005).\nWeincludedRCTsirrespectiveofpublicationstatus,dateofpubli-cation, blinding status, outcomes published,or language. We con-tactedtrialinvestigators andstudy authors toaskforrelevantdata. We included unpublished trials only if trial data and methodolog-ical descriptions were provided in written form or could be re-trieved from the trial authors. We excluded observational studies. We did not include studies using a non-standard design, such as cross-over trials and cluster-randomized trials.\nTypes of participants\nWe included adults (> 18 years of age) classiﬁed as American So-ciety of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I to IV who had received non-depolarizing NMBAs for an elective in-patient or day-case sur-gical procedure, and who consented to be included in the study. We did not include paediatric participants, healthy volunteers, or participants not undergoing surgical procedures.\n\n\n\nWhy it is important to do this review\nResidual neuromuscular block is a common complication in the post-anaesthesia care unit, with approximately 40% of patients exhibiting a TOFR < 0.9 (Murphy 2010). The clinical safety and efﬁcacy of sugammadex in reversing rocuronium-induced neuro-muscular blockade have been studied in several randomized con-trolledtrials(RCTs) thatcomparedthismedicationversusplacebo or conventional reversal agents (de Boer 2007; Gijsenbergh 2005; Sacan 2007; Sorgenfrei 2006; Sparr 2007). The aim of our re-view was to update the best available evidence on this topic and to assess the efﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex and neostigmine in reversal of neuromuscular blockade. We aimed to systematically reviewRCTsconductedtoexaminesugammadexandneostigmine administration.\nO B J E C T I V E S\nThe main objective of this review was to compare the efﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromus-cular blockade caused by non-depolarizing neuromuscular agents in adults.\nTypes of interventions\nWe included all trials comparing sugammadex versus neostigmine in adults receiving non-depolarizing NMBAs. We included any dose of sugammadex and neostigmine and any time point of ad-ministration of study drug.\nWe excluded trials that compared sugammadex and neostigmine versus only placebo or no intervention.\nTypes of outcome measures\nPrimary outcomes\n1. Recovery time from second twitch (T2) to TOFR > 0.9\n2. Recovery time from post-tetanic count (PTC) 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9\nFor our ﬁrst primary outcome “Recovery time from T2 to TOFR > 0.9”, we compared sugammadex 2 mg/kg versus neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg. For our second primary outcome “Recovery time from PTC 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9”, we compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg versus neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg. In all studies, the TOF-watch assessor used acceleromyography to measure recovery time in minutes from administration of the study drug to TOFR > 0.9 at the same monitoring site (ulnar nerve and adductor pollicis muscle).\n\n\n \nM E T H O D S	\n	Secondary outcomes\n\n\n \n					1.

We applied no language restrictions. We did a top-up search in May 2017. For speciﬁc information regarding our search strategies and results, please see Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3.\nSearching other resources\nWe searched for ongoing clinical trials and unpublished trials at the following Internet sites.\n1. www.controlled-trials.com\n2. clinicaltrials.gov\n3. www.centerwatch.com\nWe handsearched the reference lists of reviews, randomized and non-randomizedtrials,andeditorialsforadditional trials.Wecon-tacted the main authors of trials in this ﬁeld to ask about missed, unreported, and ongoing trials.

We\nWe independently extracted and collected data from each trial without blinding to study authors, source institutions, or publi-cation sources of trials. We resolved disagreements by discussion and approached all ﬁrst authors of included trials for additional informationonrisksofbias.For moredetailedinformation, please see Contributions of authors.\nAssessment of risk of bias in included studies\nWe evaluated the validity and design characteristics of each trial. We evaluated trials for major potential sources of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of partici-pants, blinding of personnel, blinding of primary outcome asses-sor, blinding of secondary outcome assessor, incomplete outcome data,selectivereporting,fundingbiasandotherbias;see Appendix 4). We assessed each trial quality factor separately and deﬁned tri-als as having low risk of bias only if they adequately fulﬁlled all of the criteria described below.\nMeasures of treatment effect\nFor our primary outcome (recovery time to TOFR > 0.9), we usedmeandifferences(MDs) with95%conﬁdenceintervals(CIs) because data were continuous and were measured in thesame way by all trials. For our secondary outcomes (risks of adverse events and serious adverse events), we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous data (binary outcomes), which were measured in the same way between trials. We also presented data for primary and secondary outcomes as relative differences.

We excludedtrials of the funnel plot to assess risk of publication and other reporting that compared only different doses of sugammadex or different bias (Higgins 2011). An asymmetrical funnel plot may indicate doses of neostigmine, as well as trials without a control group. publication of only positive results (Egger 1997).\n \nCross-over trials	Data synthesis\n\nWe planned to exclude cross-over trials from our meta-analyses\nbecause ofpotentialriskfor“carry-over”oftreatmenteffect. How-\never, we identiﬁed no cross-over trials through our search. Data analysis\n\nDealing with missing data\nWe contacted the authors of trials with missing data to retrieve relevant information. For all included trials, we noted levels of attrition and any exclusions. In cases of missing data, we chose ’complete-caseanalysis’forourprimaryoutcomes, whichexcludes fromtheanalysisallparticipantsforwhomtheoutcomeismissing. Selective outcome reporting, which occurs when non-signiﬁcant results are selectively withheld from publication (Chan 2004), is deﬁned as selection, on the basis of trial results, of a subset of the original variables recorded for inclusion in publication of trials (Hutton 2000). The most important types of selective outcome reporting include selective omission of outcomes fromreports; se-lective choice of data for an outcome; selective reporting of differ-ent analyses using the same data; selective reporting of subsets of the data; and selective underreporting of data (Higgins 2011).\nWeusedReviewManagersoftware (RevMan5.3.5)andcalculated MDs with 95% CIsfor continuous outcomes, and RRs with 95%\n2\nCIs for dichotomous variables. We used the Chi test to obtain an indicationofheterogeneitybetweentrials,withP ≤ 0.1considered signiﬁcant. We quantiﬁed the degree of heterogeneity observed in the results by using the I² statistic, which can be interpreted as the proportion of total variation observed between trialsthat is at-tributable to differencesbetween trials rather than to sampling er-ror (Higgins 2011). I²> 75% is considered as very heterogeneous. However, we chose a random-effects model for all of our analyses because clinical heterogeneity was a considerable issue beside the inter-study heterogeneity expressed by the I² statistic. Thus, we saw little rationale to carry out comparative analyses examining the impact of the choice between using a ﬁxed-effect versus a ran-dom-effects model.\nTrial sequential analysis\n\n\n\nAssessment of heterogeneity\nWe explored heterogeneity using the I2 2\nstatistic and the Chi test. An I2\nstatistic above 50% represents substantial heterogene-ity (Higgins 2011). In cases of substantial heterogeneity, we tried to determine the cause of heterogeneity by performing relevant subgroup and sensitivity analyses (excluding potential outliers to see visual impact of the overall value of the I2\nstatistic on forest plots). We used the Chi² test to provide an indication of hetero-geneity betweentrials, withaPvalue ≤ 0.1considered signiﬁcant. However, in cases of presumed substantial clinical heterogeneity within an analysis, we planned to use the random-effects model independent of I2\nvalue.\nRisk of type 1 errors in meta-analyses due to sparse data and re-peated signiﬁcance testing following updates with new trials re-mains a serious concern (Brok 2009; Thorlund 2009; Wetterslev 2008; Wetterslev 2009). As a result, spurious P values due to sys-tematicerrorsfromtrialswith highriskofbias, outcome reporting bias, publication bias, early stopping for beneﬁt, and small trial bias may resultinfalseconclusions. In asingle trial,interim analy-sis increases the risk of type 1 errors. To avoid type 1 errors, group sequential monitoring boundaries (Lan 1983) are used to decide whether a trial could be terminated early because of a sufﬁciently small P value, with the cumulative Z-curve crossing the monitor-ing boundary.\nSequential monitoring boundaries canbe appliedequallytometa-\n\nanalyses and are labelled ’trial sequential monitoring boundaries’.\nIn’trialsequentialanalysis’(TSA),theadditionofeachnew trialto Assessment of reporting biases\na cumulative meta-analysis is viewed as an interim meta-analysis, We included both published and unpublished studies during the whichprovidesusefulinformation ontheneedforadditional trials selection process.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	\n\nWhen TSA is performed, the cumulative Z-curve crossing the boundary indicates that a sufﬁcient level of evidence has been reached; as a consequence, one may conclude that no additional trials may be needed. However, evidence is insufﬁcient to allow a conclusion if the Z-curve does not cross the boundary or does not surpass the required information size.\nToconstructtrialsequentialmonitoringboundaries(TSMBs), one needs a required information size, which is calculated as the least number ofparticipantsrequiredinawell-poweredsingletrialwith low risk of bias (Brok 2009; Pogue 1998; Wetterslev 2008). In this updated review, we adjusted the required information size for heterogeneity by using the diversity adjustment factor (Wetterslev 2009). We applied TSA, as it prevents an increase in the risk of type 1 errors (20%). If the actual accrued information size was too small, we provided the required information size in the light of actual diversity (Wetterslev 2009).\n2. Sugammadex, any dose, versus neostigmine, any dose, composite adverse events, excluding meeting abstracts\nSummary of ﬁndings table and GRADE\nWe used the principles of the GRADE approach to perform an overall assessment of evidence related to all of our outcomes. We constructed a ’Summary of ﬁndings’ table using GradePro software. As outcomes of clinical interest, we chose to present re-covery time from T2 to TOFR > 0.9 (moderate block); recovery timefromPTC1to5toTOFR>0.9(deepblock);risksofadverse events, serious adverse events, bradycardia, and PONV; and signs of residual neuromuscular blockade (see Summary of ﬁndings for the main comparison; Summary of ﬁndings 2; and Summary of ﬁndings 3).\n\nSubgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\nWe conducted the following subgroup analyses.\n1.

Four studies combined participants who underwent diverse elec-tive surgical procedures (Blobner 2010; Cheong 2015; Lemmens 2010; Woo 2013).

Kizilay 2016 compared sugammadex 3 mg/kg versus neostigmine 0.03 mg/kg, Isik 2016 compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg versus neostig-mine 0.04 mg/kg. Four trials compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg versusneostigmine 0.05 mg/kg(Geldner2012; Hakimoglu 2016; Mekawy 2012; Sabo 2011). Threetrialscompared sugammadex 4 mg/kg versusneostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (Carron 2013; Jones2008; Lemmens2010). Rahe-Meyer2014 comparedsugammadex4mg/ kg versus usual care (neostigmine with glycopyrrolate or atropine, nodosespeciﬁed,orplacebo/spontaneousrecovery). Martini2014 compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg versus neostigmine 1 to 2 mg, and Riga 2014 did not specify dose for sugammadex or neostig-mine.

The ﬁrst review author (AMH) and the second review author (PD) independently assessed risk of bias for each study and resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with the last review author (AA).

Thirteen trials (32%) did not report sufﬁcient in-formationforassessmentofriskofbias(Balaka2011; Castro2014; Cheong 2015; Foletto 2014; Gaszynski 2011; Georgiou 2013; Grintescu 2009; Koc 2015; Kogler 2012; Kvolik 2012a; Kvolik 2012b; Kvolik 2013; Sherman 2014).\nAllocation concealment (selection bias)\nEighteen trials (44%) reported adequate allocation concealment performed by using sequentially numbered opaque sealed en-velopes(SNORES)(Adamus2011; Carron2013; Isik2016; Jones 2008; Martini 2014; Tas 2015; Yagan 2015); or secondary to a central randomization system (Blobner 2010; Flockton 2008;\nGeldner 2012; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Koyuncu 2015; Lemmens 2010; Rahe-Meyer2014; Raziel2013; Sabo2011; Woo2013; Wu 2014).\nOne trial (2%) reported using no allocation concealment (Kizilay 2016). Twenty-two trials (54%) did not describe their method of allocation concealment (Balaka 2011; Brueckmann 2015; Castro 2014; Cheong 2015; Foletto 2014; Gaszynski 2011; Georgiou 2013; Grintescu 2009; Hakimoglu 2016; Illman 2011; Kaufhold 2016; Koc 2015; Kogler 2012; Kvolik 2012a; Kvolik 2012b;\nKvolik 2013; Mekawy 2012; Pongracz 2013; Riga 2014; Schaller 2010; Sherman 2014; Sustic 2012).\nBlinding\nBlinding of participants (performance bias)\nFourteen trials (34%) adequately blinded participants and there-forehadlowriskofperformancebias(Adamus2011; Brueckmann 2015; Geldner 2012; Georgiou 2013; Illman 2011; Kizilay 2016; Martini 2014; Pongracz 2013; Rahe-Meyer 2014; Raziel 2013; Riga 2014; Schaller 2010; Woo 2013; Wu 2014).\nEighttrials(20%)didnotadequatelyblindparticipantsandthere-fore had high risk of performance bias; two of these speciﬁcally reported that participants were not blinded (Sustic 2012; Yagan 2015), and six were marked as “open-label” trials (Blobner 2010;\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	17\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Therefore, these trials had low risk of reporting bias.\nOne trial (2%) did not provide sufﬁcient information for assess-ment of risk of bias and had unclear risk of reporting bias (Foletto 2014).\nOther potential sources of bias\nFunding bias\nMerck, Sharp and Dohme or Schering-Plough provided ﬁnan-cial support for 11 trials (27%), indicating high risk of fund-ing bias (Blobner 2010; Geldner 2012; Illman 2011; Jones 2008; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Lemmens 2010; Martini 2014; Rahe-Meyer 2014; Sabo 2011; Woo 2013; Wu 2014). Authors of the follow-ing trials were former employees, current employees, or mem-bers of advisory boards of Merck, Sharp and Dohme/Schering-Plough, or had received honoraria for lectures, consultancy, or advisory board membership, or travel grants from Merck, Sharp and Dohme/Schering-Plough: Adamus 2011; Blobner 2010; Brueckmann 2015; Carron 2013; Flockton 2008; Gaszynski 2011; Geldner2012; Illman2011; Kaufhold2016; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Koyuncu2015; Lemmens2010; Martini2014; Rahe-Meyer 2014, Schaller 2010; Woo 2013; Wu 2014). These studies had high risk of funding bias.\nWe could not assess funding risk of bias for the following 14 trials (34%) owing to insufﬁcient information: Balaka 2011; Castro 2014; Foletto2014; Grintescu2009; Hakimoglu2016; Koc2015; Kogler 2012; Kvolik2012a; Kvolik2012b; Kvolik2013; Mekawy 2012; Pongracz 2013; Sherman 2014; Sustic 2012; these studies had unclear risk of funding bias.\nEighttrials(20%)hadlowriskoffundingbias,astheywerefunded by departmental sources (Georgiou 2013; Isik 2016; Kaufhold\n2016; Koyuncu 2015; Raziel 2013; Riga 2014; Schaller2010; Tas 2015). Trial authors funded two trials (5%) (Kizilay 2016; Yagan 2015), and in two cases (5%), study authors received research grants (Gaszynski 2011; Polish Government grant; and Cheong 2015; Inje University research grant).\nOther bias\nTwenty-onetrials(51%)hadlowriskofotherbias,astheyreported speciﬁc information on sample size calculation (Adamus 2011; Blobner 2010; Brueckmann 2015; Carron 2013; Cheong 2015; Flockton 2008; Geldner 2012; Hakimoglu 2016; Illman 2011; Isik 2016; Jones 2008; Kaufhold 2016; Koyuncu 2015; Lemmens 2010; Martini 2014; Pongracz 2013; Rahe-Meyer 2014; Sabo\n2011; Woo 2013; Wu 2014; Yagan 2015).\nOf these 21 trials, 12 (29%) were powered to address this re-view’s primary outcome (Adamus 2011; Blobner 2010; Carron 2013; Cheong 2015; Flockton 2008; Illman 2011; Jones 2008; Lemmens 2010; Pongracz 2013; Sabo 2011; Woo 2013; Wu 2014), and seven trials (17%) were powered to address this re-view’s secondary outcome (Brueckmann 2015; Geldner 2012; Hakimoglu 2016; Isik 2016; Koyuncu 2015; Rahe-Meyer 2014; Yagan 2015). Twenty trials (49%) didnot provide information on sample size calculation (Balaka 2011; Castro 2014; Foletto 2014; Gaszynski 2011; Georgiou 2013; Grintescu 2009; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Kizilay2016; Koc2015; Kogler2012; Kvolik2012a; Kvolik 2012b; Kvolik 2013; Mekawy 2012; Raziel 2013; Riga 2014; Schaller 2010; Sherman 2014; Sustic 2012; Tas 2015).\nTreatment groups were generallycomparable with respectto base-line characteristics, except Cheong 2015, which described signif-icant differences in body weight between groups that might have inﬂuenced the dosage of administered drugs; and Flockton 2008, which reported a higher proportion of women, higher mean age, andahigherpercentageof ASAIItoIII participantsinthesugam-madex group. Furthemore, Lemmens 2010 discontinued one in-terventiongroupowing toamarkeddifferenceinefﬁcacybetween groups after interim analysis. Therefore, these trials had high risk of other bias.\nAll trials used the same method (acceleromyography) and at the same monitor site (ulnar nerve, adductor pollicis muscle).

Mekawy 2012 examined recovery time from T2 to neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg for rocuronium reversal TOFR > 0.9 comparing sugammadex 4 mg/kg (n = 20) versus\nneostigmine 0.05 mg/kg plus atropine 0.02 mg/kg (n = 20) and\nreportedthatmeanreversaltime(SD)was2.47(0.51)versus24.21\n(4.7) minutes, respectively.\n1.1 Primary outcome 1: recovery time from T2 to TOFR >\n0.9\n\nTen trials were included in this category (Blobner 2010; Cheong 2015; Foletto 2014; Gaszynski 2011; Georgiou 2013; Grintescu 2009; Illman 2011; Koc 2015; Woo 2013; Wu 2014).\nAll trials used rocuronium for intubation and maintenance. The intubating dose of rocuronium was 0.6 mg/kg in ﬁve trials (Blobner 2010; Cheong 2015; Koc 2015; Woo 2013; Wu 2014), 0.6 to 1 mg/kg in Illman 2011, and 1 mg/kg in Gaszynski 2011. Themaintenancedoseofrocuroniumwas0.1to0.2mg/kginfour trials (Blobner 2010; Koc 2015; Woo 2013; Wu 2014), 0.06 mg/ kg corrected body weight (CBW) with maximum two additional doses in Gaszynski 2011, and 5 to 10 mg in two trials (Cheong 2015; Illman 2011). No information on rocuronium dosage was available for three trials (Foletto 2014; Georgiou 2013; Grintescu 2009).\nMeta-analysis of results showed that sugammadex 2 mg/kg re-versed neuromuscular blockade from T2 to TOFR > 0.9 in 1.96 minutes, and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg reversed neuromuscular blockade from T2 to TOFR > 0.9 in 12.87 minutes. Therefore, sugammadex 2 mg/kg was on average 10.22 minutes (6.6 times) faster than neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg in reversing neuromuscular blockade at T2 reappearance (MD 10.22 minutes, 95% CI 8.48 to 11.96; I2\n= 84%; 10 studies; n = 835; random-effects model; Analysis1.1; GRADE quality of evidence: moderate; Summary of ﬁndings for the main comparison). We downgraded the GRADE quality of evidence by one owing to high risk of bias.\nThe following trials used NMBAs other than rocuronium and therefore were not included in the meta-analysis.\nFlockton 2008 compared rocuronium-sugammadex 2 mg/kg ver-sus cisatracurium-neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and found that rever-sal with sugammadex was 4.7 times faster than with neostigmine (geometric mean recovery time of 1.9 vs 9.0; P < 0.0001).\nKhuenl-Brady 2010 investigated the effect of sugammadex 2 mg/ kg versus neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg in reversing vecuronium-in-duced neuromuscular blockade (induction 0.1 mg/kg, mainte-nance 0.03 to0.03mg/kg) and describedthatthegeometric mean time of recovery to TOFR > 0.9 was signiﬁcantly faster with sug-ammadex than with neostigmine (2.7 minutes, 95% CI 2.2 to 3-3 vs 17.9, 95% CI 13.1 to 24.3, respectively; P < 0.0001; n = 93). Other trials did not provide enough information or compared dosesofsugammadexandneostigmineotherthanthosepreviously mentionedandassuchcouldnotbeincludedinthemeta-analysis: Kvolik2012a comparedsugammadex2mg/kgversusneostigmine\nSubgroup analysis\n1.2 TIVA versus volatile anaesthetics\nSeven trials maintained anaesthesia with volatile anaesthetic (Blobner 2010; Cheong 2015; Gaszynski 2011; Grintescu 2009; Illman 2011; Koc 2015; Woo 2013), and three trials used TIVA for maintenance (Foletto 2014; Georgiou 2013; Wu 2014). Sub-group analysis of results showed no signiﬁcant subgroup differ-ences in recovery time to TOFR > 0.9 (Analysis 1.2).\nSensitivity analysis\n1.3.

Both trials used rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg as a single intubat-ing dose and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg for maintenance. Carron 2013 combined neostigmine with atropine0.01 mg/kg, and Jones 2008 combined neostigmine with glycopyrrolate 0.014 mg/kg. Carron 2013 administered sugammadex or neostigmine at reap-pearance of PTC 1 to 5, and Jones 2008 at reappearance of PTC 1 to 2. Carron 2013 included morbidly obese female participants. Carron 2013 maintained anaesthesia with desﬂurane, and Jones 2008 with sevoﬂurane.\nMeta-analysis of trial results showed that sugammadex 4 mg/kg reversedneuromuscular blockadefromPTC1to5toTOFR>0.9 in 2.9 minutes, and neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg reversed neuromus-cular blockade from PTC 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9 in 48.8 minutes. Sugammadex 4 mg/kg was therefore on average 45.78 minutes (16.8 times) faster than neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg inreversing neu-romuscular blockade at reappearance of PTC 1 to 5 (MD 45.78 minutes, 95% CI 39.41 to 52.15; I2\n= 0%; two studies; n = 114; random-effects model; Analysis 2.1; GRADE quality of evidence: low; Summary of ﬁndings 2). We downgraded GRADE quality of evidence two levels owing to high risk of bias and imprecision. The following trials used NMBAs other than rocuronium, gave a dose of neostigmine different from the one described above, or had missing SD values and were not included in the meta-analysis. Lemmens 2010 investigated the effect of sugammadex 4 mg/kg versus neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg in reversing vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade (induction 0.1 mg/kg, mainte-nance 0.015 mg/kg) and described that the geometric mean time of recovery to TOFR > 0.9 was 15-fold faster with sugammadex than with neostigmine (4.5 vs 66.2 minutes, respectively; P < 0.0001; n = 83). Geldner 2012 reported that participants receiv-ing sugammadex 4 mg/kg administered at PTC 1 to 2 recovered 3.4 times faster than those given neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg plus atropine 0.01 mg/kg(geometric mean recoverytime of 2.4 (2.1 to 2.7) vs 8.4 (7.2 to 9.8) minutes, respectively; P < 0.0001). Kogler 2012, reported that median recovery time from PTC 1 to 2 to TOFR > 0.9 after sugammadex 2 mg/kg was 1.1 minutes versus 10.13 minutes for neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (P < 0.001; n = 31; no SD value reported).\nOther recovery times\nSome trials measured recovery times other than those described in the comparisons above. Only single trials measured these data; therefore, we could not include them in the meta-analysis, but we can describe the qualitative data as follows.\nBalaka 2011 reported mean recovery time from TOFR of 50% to > 90% as 9.7 minutes after administration of neostigmine 2.5 mg and 2.8 minutes after administration of sugammadex 4 mg/ kg (P < 0.05; n = 40). Yagan 2015 compared sugammadex 2 mg/ kg versus neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg administered at T4/T1 20% and found that extubation time (deﬁned as time to TOFR > 0.9) was seven minutes in the neostigmine group and two minutes in the sugammadex group (P > 0.05; n = 36). Martini 2014 com-pared moderate NMB (T1 to 2) induced by atracurium/mivac-urium reversed by neostigmine 1 to 2 mg plus atropine 0.5 to 1 mg (n = 12) versus deep NMB (PTC 1 to 2) induced by high-dose rocuronium and reversed by sugammadex 4 mg/kg (n = 12). Recovery times to TOFR > 0.9 expressed as mean (SD) were, re-spectively, 10.9 (4.9) versus 5.1 (2.4) (P < 0.01). Pongracz 2013 investigated adequate doses for reversal of reappearance of four twitchesofTOFanddiscoveredthatsugammadex1mg/kg,unlike neostigmine, rapidly and effectively reverses rocuronium-induced block that has recovered spontaneously to threshold TOF count four.Furthermore,sugammadex0.5mg/kgreversesasimilar block within eight minutes. Sabo 2011 compared sugammadex 4.0 mg/ kg versus neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg plus glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/ kg administered when the TOF-blinded anaesthesiologist consid-ered the patient ready for reversal of NMB. The anaesthesiolo-gist could ask the TOF-watch operator whether the patient had recovered to at least 1 to 2 PTC before administering the rever-sal agent. This trial demonstrated signiﬁcantly faster recovery to TOFR > 0.9 ratio within two minutes (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) in the sugammadex group versus eight minutes (95% CI 3.8 to 16.5 minutes) intheneostigmine group. Schaller2010 investigated the efﬁcacy of sugammadex (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg), neostigmine (5, 8, 15, 25, or 40 µg/kg), and saline, and by using a bi-exponential model and regression analysis concluded that sug-ammadex 0.22 mg/kg and neostigmine 34 µg/kg effectively and comparably reverse a rocuronium-induced shallow residual neu-romuscular blockatTOFR=0.5(n=99). Kaufhold2016 investi-gatedseveraldifferentdosesofsugammadexorneostigmine aswell as placebo administered at TOFR ≥ 0.2 and found that residual neuromuscular block of TOFR = 0.2 cannot be reversed reliably withneostigminewithin10minutes.However,substantiallylower doses of sugammadex than the approved dose of 2.0 mg/kg may be sufﬁcient to reverse residual rocuronium-induced neuromus-\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	21\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Koyuncu 2015 looked at the effects of sugammadex 2 mg/kg (n = 50) versus neostigmine 70 µg/kg + atropine 0.4 mg per 1 mg neostigmine administered when four twitches of TOF were visible with fade and found that sugammadex speeds recovery of neuromuscular strength but only slightly (P > 0.01; n = 100).\nComparison 3. Sugammadex (any dose) versus\nneostigmine (any dose)\nPrimary outcome 1: recovery time from T2 to TOFR > 0.9 This outcome was not clinically relevantas doses for sugammadex and neostigmine used are speciﬁc to the depth of the neuromus-cular blockade.\nPrimary outcome 2: recovery time from PTC 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9\nThis outcome was not clinically relevantas doses for sugammadex and neostigmine used are speciﬁc to the depth of the neuromus-cular blockade.\n3.1. Secondary outcomes: risks of adverse events and serious adverse events\nThe following 28 trials investigated adverse events possibly, prob-ably, or deﬁnitely related to study drug: Adamus 2011; Balaka 2011; Blobner 2010; Brueckmann 2015; Carron 2013; Castro 2014; Cheong 2015; Flockton 2008; Gaszynski 2011; Geldner 2012; Hakimoglu 2016; Illman 2011; Jones 2008; Kaufhold 2016; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Kizilay 2016; Koc2015; Kogler2012; Koyuncu 2015; Kvolik 2012a; Lemmens 2010; Mekawy 2012; Pongracz 2013; Sabo 2011; Schaller 2010; Woo 2013; Wu 2014; Yagan 2015.\nMeta-analysis of trial results showed signiﬁcantly fewer adverse events in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.74; I2\n= 40%; 28 studies, n = 2298; random-effectsmodel; Analysis3.1;GRADEqualityofdata:mod-erate; Summaryofﬁndings3;qualityofevidencedowngradedone level owing to high risk of bias). Speciﬁcally, the risk of composite adverse events was 283/1000 in the neostigmine group and 159/ 1000 in the sugammadex group. With number needed to treat for an additional beneﬁcial outcome (NNTB) of eight to avoid an adverse event, sugammadex appears to have a stronger safety pro-ﬁle than neostigmine. Furthermore, data show signiﬁcantly fewer participants with one or more adverse events (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.81; I2\n= 0%; n = 1766; random-effects model; Analysis 3.5; GRADE quality of data: moderate; Summary of ﬁndings 3) in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group. Data on speciﬁc adverse events show signiﬁcantly less risk of the following adverse events in the sugammadex group than in the\nneostigmine group: bradycardia (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34; I2 Analysis 3.6; NNTB\n= 0%; n = 1218; random-effects model;\n14; GRADE quality of data: moderate; Summary of ﬁndings 3; downgraded one level owing to high risk of bias), PONV (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.97; I2\n= 0%; n = 389; random-effects model; Analysis 3.7; NNTB 16; GRADE quality of data: low; Summary of ﬁndings 3; downgraded two levelsowing to high risk of bias and imprecision), desaturation (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06\n2\nto 0.83; I = 0%; n = 134; random-effects model; Analysis 3.8), need for transitory oxygen supplementation (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.66; I2 Analysis\n= 0%; n = 76; random-effects model;\n3.10), and procedural complications (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.97; n=168; I2\n=0%;random-effectsmodel; Analysis3.9).Also, signiﬁcantly fewer participants were unable to perform 5 seconds of sustained head-lift at extubation (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to\n2\n0.78; I = 0%; n = 395; random-effects model; Analysis 3.11) in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group.\nData show no signiﬁcant differences between sugammadex and neostigmine with regard to nausea (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.56; I2 Analysis 3.13), vomiting (RR 2.05, 95%\n= 0%; n = 719;\n2\nCI 0.50 to 8.48; I = 0%; n = 297; Analysis 3.14), postprocedural\n2\nnausea(RR1.39, 95% CI0.27to7.12; I =0%; n=168; Analysis\n2\n3.15),headache(RR1.02,95%CI0.48to2.18; I =0%;n=388; Analysis 3.16), hypertension(RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.23 to9.05; I2\n= 0%; n= 287; Analysis3.17), hypotension (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.96; I2 Analysis 3.18), cough (RR 1.42, 95%\n= 0%; n = 465;\nCI 0.42 to 4.81; I2\n= 65%; n = 200; Analysis 3.19), dry mouth (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.87; I2 Analysis\n= 17%; n = 289;\n),dizziness (RR0.98, 95% CI0.10to9.23; I2\n3.20 =0%; n=168; Analysis 3.21), tachycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.22; I2\n= 0%; n = 338; Analysis 3.22), pruritus (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.20 to 12.88;I2 Analysis3.23),pyrexia(RR1.43,95%CI\n=0%;n=175;\n0.23to8.91;I2\n=0%;n=264; Analysis3.24),shivering(RR0.75, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.43; I2 Analysis 3.25), chills(RR\n= 0%; n = 190;\n4.04,95%CI0.46to35.85; I2 Analysis3.26),rash\n=0%;n=166;\n(RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.96; I2\n=0%; n= 701; Analysis 3.27), supraventricular extrasystoles (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.05; I2 = 0%; n = 189; Analysis 3.28), laryngospasm (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.65; I2 Analysis 3.29), increased upper\n= 0%; n = 100;\nairwaysecretion(RR0.37,95%CI0.09to1.59;I2\n=0%;n=442; Analysis 3.30), procedural complications (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.97; I2\n= 0%; n = 168; Analysis 3.9), procedural hypertension (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.21; I2 Analysis 3.31),\n=0%; n= 267;\nprocedural hypotension (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.02 to 14.15; I2\n= 60%; n = 391; Analysis 3.32), abdominal pain (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.27; I2\n= 0%; n = 196; Analysis 3.33).

A single trial observed some drug-related adverse events; there-fore, we could not include them in a meta-analysis of speciﬁc ad-verse events, but we used the data to calculate overall risk of ad-verse events. The following isolated adverse events were observed in the sugammadex group: three cases of breath-hold (10%) in Hakimoglu 2016, two cases of strange taste in the mouth (6%) in Gaszynski 2011, two cases of increased beta-N-acetyl-D-glu-cosaminidase (6%) in Flockton 2008, two cases of bronchospasm (4%) in Koyuncu 2015, and one case of each of the following: severe abdominal pain (2%), pharyngolaryngeal pain (2%), diar-rhoea (2%), and tinnitus (2%) in Blobner 2010; decreased hema-tocrit (1%) and procedural haemorrhage (1%) in Brueckmann 2015; tremor (3%) and altered facial sensation (3%) in Flockton 2008; postprocedural hypertension (3%), paraesthesia (3%), and increased blood creatinine phosphokinase (3%) in Jones 2008; retching (2%), airway complication to anaesthesia (2%), and hot ﬂush (2%) in Khuenl-Brady 2010; procedural pain (2%) in Sabo 2011; leukocytosis (2%) in Lemmens 2010; mildhypoventilation (1%) in Wu 2014; and ﬁnally one case of intraoperative move-ment (2%) in Schaller 2010.\nIn the neostigmine group, the following isolated drug-related ad-verse events were reported: four cases of breath-hold (13%) in Hakimoglu 2016; two cases of albumin present in the urine (4%) in Blobner 2010; two cases of leukocytosis (5%) in Lemmens 2010; and one case of each of the following: involuntary mus-cle contractions (2%), visual accommodation disorder (2%), in-creasedurinebeta-2microglobulin(2%),severebradycardia(2%), and productive cough (2%) in Blobner 2010; respiratory distress (1%) and delayedrecovery fromanaesthesia (1%) in Brueckmann 2015; hyperhidrosis (3%), decreased blood protein (3%), restless-ness(3%),chestdiscomfort(3%),incisionsitecomplication(3%), and postprocedural complication (3%) in Jones 2008; ventricu-lar extrasystoles (2%), sleepdisorder (2%), and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (2%) in Khuenl-Brady 2010; anxiety (3%), depression (3%), and fatigue (3%) in Lemmens 2010; dyspepsia (2%) andsomnolence (2%) in Sabo2011;severemuscleweakness (1%) in Wu 2014; and ﬁnally one case of intraoperative move-ment (2%) in Schaller 2010.\nWehavedescribedin Table3 eachobservedadverseeventpossibly, probably, or deﬁnitely related to sugammadex or neostigmine. This table also presents risk of adverse events in descending order, as well as the number of studies observing each adverse event.\nThe largest trial in this review (Rahe-Meyer 2014) randomized 1198 participants and reported that 64 out of 596 participants (10.7%) in the sugammadex group and 72 out of 588 (12.2 %)in the usual care group had at least one drug-related adverse event. Unfortunately, wecouldnot include thesedatainour meta-analy-\nsis, as the “usual care” group combined participants who received eitherneostigmine or placebo,andwewerenotable toobtain data from the neostigmine group.\nSubgroup analysis of composite adverse events\n3.2 Different dosages of sugammadex and neostigmine\nDifferenttrialsuseddifferentdosagesofsugammadexandneostig-mine.\nAdamus 2011 compared sugammadex 2 mg/kg versus neostig-mine 0.04 mg/kg. Twelve trials compared sugammadex 2 mg/ kg versus neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (Blobner 2010; Castro 2014; Cheong 2015; Flockton 2008; Gaszynski 2011; Illman 2011; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Koc 2015; Kvolik 2012b; Woo 2013; Wu 2014; Yagan 2015). Two trials compared sugammadex 2 mg/kg versus neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (Kogler 2012; Koyuncu 2015). Balaka 2011 compared sugammadex 2 mg/kg versus neostigmine 2.5 mg. Kizilay 2016 compared sugammadex 3 mg/kg versus neostigmine0.03mg/kg.Fourtrialscomparedsugammadex4mg/ kg versus neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (Geldner 2012; Hakimoglu 2016; Mekawy 2012; Sabo 2011). Three trials compared sugam-madex 4 mg/kg versus neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (Carron 2013; Jones 2008; Lemmens 2010). Four trials compared several dif-ferent doses of sugammadex versus several different doses of neostigmine (Brueckmann 2015; Kaufhold2016; Pongracz 2013; Schaller 2010). Subgroup analysis of data showed no signiﬁcant subgroup differencesin RRforcomposite adverseevents(Analysis 3.2).\n3.3.

Six trials used atropine (Carron 2013; Gaszynski 2011; Geldner 2012; Koc 2015; Koyuncu 2015; Wu 2014).Fivetrialsusedglycopyrrolate(Blobner2010; Brueckmann 2015; Cheong 2015; Schaller 2010; Woo 2013). Subgroup anal-ysis of trial results showed no signiﬁcant subgroup differences in RR for bradycardia (Analysis 3.6).\nSubgroup analysis of PONV\n3.9 TIVA versus volatile anaesthetics\nFive trials maintained anaesthesia with volatile anaesthetic (Adamus 2011; Castro 2014; Cheong 2015; Hakimoglu 2016; Yagan 2015), One trial used TIVA for maintenance (Schaller 2010).Subgroupanalysisoftrialresultsshowednosigniﬁcantsub-group differences in RR for PONV (Analysis 3.7).\nQualitative data\nInvestigators reported effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on the following parameters in data format that was ineligible for meta-analysis.\nIntraocular pressure (IOP)\nHakimoglu 2016 described that post-extubation intraocular pres-sures (IOPs) were similar between sugammadex and neostigmine groups (P > 0.05; n = 60); Yagan 2015 reported lower end-extu-bation IOPs when sugammadex 2 mg/kg was used in comparison with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg - atropine 0.02 mg/kg (P < 0.05; n = 36), suggesting that sugammadex may be a better option for reversal of neuromuscular blockade in conditions for which an increase in IOP is not desired, such as glaucoma and penetrating eye injury.\nBleeding events\nThe largest trial in this review Rahe-Meyer 2014; n = 1198)\n(\nincluded participants undergoing hip/knee surgery or hip frac-ture surgery and compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg versus usual care(neostigmineorspontaneousrecovery).Investigatorsreported bleedingeventswithin24hoursin17(2.9%)sugammadexand24 (4.1%) usual care participants (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.29). Compared with usual care, increases of 5.5% in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; P < 0.001) and 3.0% in prothrom-bin time (P< 0.001) frombaseline occurred with sugammadex 10 minutesafteradministrationandresolvedwithin60minutes.Data show no signiﬁcant differences between sugammadex and usual care forotherblood lossmeasures(transfusion, 24-hour drain vol-ume, drop in haemoglobin, and anaemia) or for risk of venous thromboembolism, and trials reported no cases of anaphylaxis. Sugammadex induced limited (< 8% at 10 minutes) and transient (< 1 hour) increases in aPTT and prothrombin time but was not associated with increased risk of bleeding or increased severity of bleeding. A much smaller trial (Tas 2015; n = 50) investigated effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on postoperative coagu-lation parametersand bleedingafter seroplasty with sugammadex, increasing postoperative bleeding measured by nasal tip dressings (4.1 ± 2.7 mL in the sugammadex group vs 2.5 ± 2.7 mL in the neostigmine group;P=0.013) withoutsigniﬁcantly affecting pro-thrombin time (PT) (P = 0.953), aPTT values (P = 0.734), or international normalized ratio (INR) values (P = 0.612).\nMekawy 2012 reportedno differencesin intraoperative blood loss betweensugammadex4mg/kg(n=20)andneostigmine 0.05mg/ kg plus atropine 0.02 mg/kg groups (104.6 ± 13.2 vs 111.2 ± 9.8 mL, respectively; P = 0.060)\nRenal function\nIsik 2016 (n = 50) investigated effects of neostigmine and sugam-madex on kidney function and found that both drugs may affect kidney function but sugammadex has more tolerable effects than neostigmine.\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	24\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Values of plasma paracetamol concentration (PPC) immediately after arrival of participants in the recovery room (T0) were signiﬁcantly higher between the sugammadex 2 mg/kggroup(1.2±0.9)andtheneostigmine0.04mg/kg/atropine 0.015mg/kggroup(0.4±0.4)(P<0.01).ValuesofPPCat15,30, 60, 120, and 150 minutes were higher without reaching statistical difference: T15, 2.1 ± 1.5 vs 1.5 ± 1.4; T30, 3.7 ± 3.8 vs 2.9 ± 2.2; T60, 4.2 ± 2.8 vs 3.5 ± 2.7; T120, 5.0 ± 3.4 vs 4.6 ± 3.6; and T150, 5.9 ± 3.4 vs 4.9 ± 3.2.\nValuesforPPCat90minuteswereminimallyhigherintheneostig-mine-atropine group: time 90, 4.6 ± 3.4 vs 4.7 ± 3.4 (P = NS). Study authors concluded that although results show a tendency toward faster gastric emptying in the sugammadex group, this dif-ference did not reach statistical difference, possibly owing to the small sample size of the study .\nThyroid function\nKvolik2012a (n=24) investigatedeffectsonthyroidfunctionand observed a signiﬁcant increase in T4 levels compared with base-line one hour after anaesthesia (from 13.3 to 17.5 in the neostig-mine group, and from 12.6 to 16.2 pmol/L in the sugammadex group; P < 0.05) that returned to baseline after 24 hours in both groups. T3 decreased in both groups postoperatively (from 5.2 to 3.5 in the neostigmine group, and from 4.9 to 3.3 pmol/L in the sugammadex group), with no intergroup differences noted (P > 0.05). Mean thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) after 24 hours was not different between groups (1.32 in the neostigmine group vs 1.27 pmol/L in the sugammadex group; P = 0.49). In conclu-sion, sugammadex treatment did not change the levels of thyroid hormones and may be used safely in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy.\nCognitive function\nRiga 2014 (n = 114) investigated cognitive function in patients receiving sugammadex or neostigmine and found no signiﬁcant differences between groups when measuring cognitive function with the mini-mental state evaluation test (P = 0.25), as described in Tombaugh 1992, and the Clock Drawing test (P = 0.06), as described in Agrell 1998.\nPostoperative vomiting and nausea (PONV)\nCarron 2013 reported higher PONV scores in the neostigmine group than in the sugammadex group (3.2 ± 1.5 vs 1.9 ± 1.3;\nP = 0.015; n = 40) with no signiﬁcant difference in antiemetic supplement (7 (35%) vs 3 (15%); P = 0.10).\nTas2015 comparedsugammadex 2mg/kg(n=24) versusneostig-mine 0.05 mg/kg plus atropine 0.02 mg/kg (n = 26) and reported no differences regarding nausea/vomiting between groups (P = 0.512).\nRaziel2013 (n=40)observednodifferencesbetweensugammadex 2 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg in nausea/vomiting among morbidly obese participants undergoing bariatric surgery.\nPain\nMartini 2014 compared moderate NMB (T1 to T2) induced by atracurium/mivacurium reversed by neostigmine 1 to 2 mg plus atropine 0.5 to 1 mg (n = 12) versus deep NMB (PTC 1 to 2) induced by high-dose rocuronium and reversedby sugammadex 4 mg/kg(n=12)andfoundnosigniﬁcantdifferencesinpainscoreas measured by a 10-point scale (2.6 ± 1.6 vs 2.1 ± 2.2, respectively).

The following 15 studies reportedany of theseadverse events: Balaka 2011; Blobner 2010; Brueckmann 2015; Carron 2013; Flockton 2008; Geldner 2012; Jones 2008; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Koyuncu 2015; Kvolik 2012b; Lemmens2010; Mekawy2012; Schaller2010; Woo2013; Wu 2014).\nMeta-analysis of trial results showed signiﬁcantly reduced risk of overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28to0.57;I2\n=0%;n=1474;random-effectsmodel;NNTB13; Analysis 3.39; GRADE quality of evidence: moderate; Summary of ﬁndings 3) in the sugammadex group when compared with the neostigmine group.

Martini 2014 compared moderate NMB (T1 to T2) induced by atracurium/mivacurium reversed by neostigmine 1 to 2 mg plus atropine 0.5 to 1 mg (n = 12) with deep NMB (PTC 1 to 2) induced by high-dose rocuronium and reversedby sugammadex 4 mg/kg (n = 12), and found no signiﬁcant difference in saturation in PACU (98.6 ± 1.8 vs 98.2 ± 1.4, respectively) or breathing rate in PACU (14.5 ± 2.2 vs 14.5 ± 2.2, respectively).\nSherman 2014 found lower saturation levels (95.8 ± 0.014 vs 96.72 ± 0.01; P < 0.02), lower minimal saturation (93% vs 94%), and no difference in respiratory complications when comparing neostigmine 2.5 mg (n = 25) versus sugammadex 2 mg/kg (n = 32).\nTas2015 comparedsugammadex 2mg/kg(n=24) versusneostig-mine 0.05 mg/kg plus atropine 0.02 mg/kg (n = 26) and reported no differences between groups regarding saturation levelsafter ex-tubation (97.6 ± 0.2 vs 98.0 ± 0.2, respectively; P = 0.280).\nFurthermore, several trials conducted postoperative neuromus-cular monitoring to quantify the risk of residual neuromuscular blockade, deﬁned as TOFR < 0.9: Brueckmann 2015 found that zero out of 74 (0%) sugammadex participants and 33 out of 76 (43.4%) neostigmine participants had TOFR > 0.9 at PACU ad-mission (odds ratio (OR) 0.0, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6; P < 0.0001). Of the 33 neostigmine participants, 2 also had clinical evidence of residual NMB.\nSabo 2011 described that 2 out of 50 participants (4%) in the sugammadexgrouphadresidualNMB(TOFR<0.9)atthetimeof extubation compared with 26 out of 43 participants (60.5) in the neostigmine group, although data provided no clinical evidence (i.e. respiratory problems) of residual NMB in either group.\nGaszynski 2011 described that TOF at PACU was 109.8% versus 85.5% (P < 0.05; n = 70) in the sugammadex and neostigmine groups, respectively, and reached > 90% in every case in the sug-ammadex group but not in the neostigmine group.\nNo participants experienced recurrence of neuromuscular block-ade based on neuromuscular monitoring in Geldner 2012 (n = 133).\nSugammadex (any dose) versus neostigmine (any dose), drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs)\nFourteen trials reported serious adverse events (SAEs) possibly, probably, or deﬁnitely related to study drug (Adamus 2011; Blobner 2010; Brueckmann 2015; Flockton2008; Geldner2012; Hakimoglu 2016; Jones 2008; Kaufhold 2016; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Koyuncu2015; Lemmens2010; Schaller2010; Woo 2013; Wu2014). Meta-analysis of trial resultsshowed no signiﬁcant dif-ferences between sugammadex and neostigmine regarding partic-ipants with one or more serious adverse events or for compos-\n2\nite adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.25; I = 0%; ten studies; n = 959; random-effects model; Analysis 3.40; GRADE qualityofevidence:low; Summaryofﬁndings3).Wedowngraded GRADE quality of evidence two levels owing to high risk of bias and imprecision.\nClearly reported drug-related serious adverse events included one case of acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and inadequate NMB reversalin theneostigmine group (Brueckmann 2015),one caseofacutelungfailureintheneostigminegroup(Schaller 2010), onecaseofpostoperativeupperabdominalpainintheneostigmine group (Geldner 2012) one case of postprocedural haemorrhage\n,\nin the sugammadex group (Brueckmann 2015), and ﬁnally one caseofrespiratorydepressioninthesugammadexgroup(Koyuncu 2015).\nTrial sequential analysis (TSA)\nWeappliedTSA toseveraloutcome data asdescribedin Summary of ﬁndings for the main comparison, Summary of ﬁndings 2, and Summary of ﬁndings 3.\nTSAofalltrialscomparingneostigmine 0.05mg/kgversussugam-madex 2.0 mg/kg with regard to recovery time from T2 to TOFR > 0.9 minutes indicates that with a required information size of 106, ﬁrm evidence sugammadex in a random-effects model, with analfa-boundaryadjustedMDof-10.22(95%CI-12.11to-8.33; diversity (D2 2\n) =87%; I = 84%; random-effects model; Figure 1). The cumulative Z-curve crossed the monitoring boundary con-structed for the required information size with 80% power and alpha of 0.05. However, none of the included trials had low risk of bias, and given that TSA is ideally designed for trials with low risk of bias and cannot be adjusted for risk of bias, the precision of our ﬁndings has to be downgraded. Furthermore, we found a high degreeof diversity and heterogeneity,which once again raises questions about the reliability of the calculated required informa-tion size.\nTSA of dichotomous data on drug-related risk of adverse events when neostigmine (any dose) was compared with sugammadex (any dose) with continuity adjustment for zero event trials (0.001 in each arm) resulted in an alfa-boundary adjusted RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.74; diversity (D2 2\n) = 34%; I = 14%; ran-dom-effects model; Figure 3), with a control event proportion of 27.97%.

Despite the fact that the cumulative Z-curve does not cross the monitoring boundary directly, it is hard to imagine future trials radically changing the overall picture of this analysis. Once again, none of the included trials had low risk of bias and this does downgrade the reliability of our ﬁnding.\nTSA of dichotomous data on risk of serious adverse events when neostigmine (any dose) was compared with sugammadex (any dose) with continuity adjustment for zero event trials (0.001 in each arm) resulted in an alfa-boundary adjusted RR of 0.35 (95% CI 0.00 to 3190; diversity (D2 2\n) = 0%; I = 0%; random-effects model), with a control event proportion of 1.04%. The cumula-tive Z-curve does not cross the monitoring boundary constructed for a required information size of 8189 participants, with 11.71% of the required information size included across included trials so far with 80% power and alpha of 0.05. Once again, none of the included trials had low risk of bias and this affects the reliability and precision of our estimates.\nTSA of dichotomous data on risk of signs of residual neuromus-cular blockade when neostigmine (any dose) was compared with sugammadex (anydose)withcontinuity adjustmentforzeroevent trials (0.001 in each arm) resulted in an alfa-boundary adjusted RR of 0.4 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.59; diversity (D2 2\n) = 0%; I = 0%; random-effectsmodel),with80%powerandalphaof0.05(Figure 4),withacontroleventproportionof13.08%. ThecumulativeZ-curve crosses the monitoring boundary constructed for a required information size of 424 participants, indicating ﬁrm evidence in favour of sugammadex. However,as previously described, none of the included trials had low risk of bias and this equally diminishes the reliability and precision of our estimates.\nFinally, owing to overall high risks of bias, imprecision, and indi-rectness involved in assessment of GRADE for the above analysis, one could easily argue that the required power should be 90% -not 80% - by which the required information size would be in-creased; neverthelesswe cannot rule out the direction of results in favour of sugammadex, despite the absence of large trialswith low risk of bias.\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	27\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

For meta-analyses of primary outcomes, 12 studies (n = 949) were eligible.\nMeta-analysis of trial results showed that sugammadex 2 mg/kg reversed NMB from second twitch (T2) to train-of-four ratio (TOFR) > 0.9 in 1.96 minutes, and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg re-versed NMB from T2 to TOFR > 0.9 in 12.87 minutes. Sug-ammadex 2 mg/kg was therefore on average 10.22 minutes (6.6 times) faster than neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg in reversing NMB at\nT2 reappearance (mean difference (MD) 10.22 minutes, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 8.48 to 11.96; I2\n= 84%; ten studies; n = 835; random-effects model; GRADE quality of evidence: moder-ate; Analysis 1.1). Reversal time from post-tetanic count (PTC) 1 to5 toTOFR >0.9 was notinvestigated; thiswas considered clin-ically irrelevant owing to the doses of sugammadex and neostig-mine used for this comparison.\nSugammadex 4 mg/kg reversed NMB from PTC 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9 in 2.9 minutes, and neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg reversedNMB from PTC 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9 in 48.8 minutes. Sugammadex 4 mg/kg was therefore on average 45.78 minutes (16.8 times) faster than neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg in reversing NMB at PTC 1 to 5 reappearance (MD 45.78 minutes, 95% CI 39.41 to 52.15; I2\n= 0%; n= 114; random-effects model;GRADE quality of evidence: low; Analysis 2.1). Reversal time from T2 to TOFR > 0.9 was not investigated since it was deemed clinically irrelevant owing to the doses of sugammadex and neostigmine used for this comparison.\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	35\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	\n\nWe found 28 trials (n = 2298) eligible for meta-analysis of the secondary outcomes (risks of adverse events and serious adverse events). We found signiﬁcantly fewer composite adverse events in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group (risk ra-tio (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.74; I2\n= 40%; 28 studies; n = 2298; random-effects model; GRADE quality of data: moderate; Analysis3.1).Speciﬁcally,theriskofcomposite adverseeventswas 283/1000 in the neostigmine group and 159/1000 in the sugam-madexgroup.Analysisofnumber neededtotreatforanadditional beneﬁcial outcome (NNTB) revealed that eight patients should betreatedwithsugammadex ratherthenneostigmine toavoid one patient experiencing a single random adverse event. Furthermore, signiﬁcantly fewer participants had one or more adverse events (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.81; I2\n= 0%; n = 1766; random-effectsmodel; GRADE quality of data: moderate; Analysis 3.5) in the sugammadex group than in the neostigmine group. Review of speciﬁc adverse events in the sugammadex group compared with theneostigmine grouprevealedsigniﬁcantly lessriskofthe follow-ing adverse events: bradycardia (Analysis 3.6), postoperative nau-sea and vomiting (PONV) (Analysis 3.7), desaturation (Analysis 3.8), and need for transitory oxygen supplementation (Analysis 3.10). Also, a signiﬁcantly lower number of participants in the sugammadex group were not able to perform 5 second sustained head-lift at extubation (Analysis 3.11). Data showed no signiﬁ-cant differences between sugammadex and neostigmine regarding participants with one or more serious adverse events, nor in com-posite adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.25; I2\n= 0%; ten studies; n = 959; random-effects model; GRADE quality of evidence: low; Analysis 3.40). Reversal time from T2 and PTC 1 to 5 to TOFR > 0.9 was not investigated, as it is clinically irrele-vant owing to the doses of sugammadex and neostigmine used for this comparison.\nOverall completeness and applicability of\nevidence\nFor our primary outcome, we performed a comparison of the ef-fects of sugammadex and neostigmine at two depths of NMB: moderateblockasindicatedbyreappearanceofT2,anddeepblock as indicated by reappearance of PTC 1 to 5 on neuromuscular monitoring. However, administration of neostigmine is not rec-ommended for reversal of deep block and absence of any signs of neuromuscular recovery due to the ceiling effect (Caldwell 2009; Plaud 2010), which is seen when maximal acetylcholine concen-tration is not sufﬁcient to adequately compete with the muscle relaxant. According to the current prescribing information, this is an off-label indication (www.fda.gov). Nevertheless, our search identiﬁed two trials (Carron 2013, Jones 2008) in which sugam-madex andneostigmine were usedtoreverse rocuronium-induced deepNMB,and onetrial (Lemmens2010) inwhichsugammadex and neostigmine were used to reverse vecuronium-induced deep block. As this was not an exclusion criterion in the original pro-\ntocol and the data were available, we chose to include these three studies in our review. However, for reasons explained above, the clinical importance of these comparatory ﬁndings aside from the obvious faster reversal due to sugammadex remains questionable. In this context, one could argue that a comparison between sug-ammadexandneostigmine forreversingashallowNMBwould be more relevant. However, this was not a predeﬁned outcome in the original protocol. Furthermore, our search identiﬁed ﬁve trials in whichsomedegreeofshallowblockwasindicated(Kaufhold2016; Koyuncu 2015; Pongracz 2013; Schaller 2010; Yagan 2015), but none of these trials obtained comparable data on recovery time to TOFR > 0.9.\nThe overall quantity of data on which our conclusions can be based is large, and data were drawn from 41 randomized con-trolled trials with 4206 participants. According to GRADE, the quality of evidence for most of our meta-analyses is moderate. Most trial participants were adults classiﬁed as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I to III who were undergoing elective surgery, and reported outcomes were relevant in a clinical setting. Primary and secondary outcomes, recovery time to TOFR > 0.9, and adverse effects, were generally well reported. Therefore, on basis of the large number of identiﬁed studies and participants, available evidence seems to be applicable to adult patients of ASA classiﬁcation I to III who are undergoing elective surgery.\nAccording to our meta-analyses, sugammadex 2 mg/kg given at T2 reverses the NMB within 1.96 minutes and 6.6 times (10.22 minutes) faster than neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (12.87 minutes). Furthermore, sugammadex 4 mg/kg, given to deep NMB at PTC 1 to 5 reappearance, reverses the block in 2.9 minutes and 16.8 times (45.78 minutes) faster than neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (48.8 minutes).\nThe time difference offers several potential advantages in that a patient who is paralysed with a neuromuscular blocking agent has to be out of the NMB with TOFR > 0.9 before undergoing tra-cheal extubation, to avoid adverse effects due to residual paralysis (Eikermann 2006; Murphy 2008; Murphy 2013).\nSugammadex rapidly reverses NMB. This appears favourable be-cause it reduces required anaesthesia time for the patient. Addi-tionally, unlike neostigmine, sugammadex can be administered at any stage during a surgical procedure and independent of the depth of blockade. A reduced duration of anaesthesia not only may improve recovery time for the patient but could potentially reduce costs by saving the time neededfor aprolonged awakening and potentially enabling smoother ﬂow of patients through the operating theatre.\nThe cost-effectiveness of sugammadex was not a predeﬁned out-come of this review. To demonstrate cost-effectiveness of sugam-madex, two issues must be established: reduced patient recovery time perioperatively, and translation of any such reduction into resource utilization in terms of freeing up staff to work on pro-ductive alternative activities such ascaring for other patients. This outcome is very difﬁcult to assess owing to various confounders,\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	36\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to calculate whether any re-duction in adverse events associated with sugammadex, besides improved quality of care, can readily be translated into cost-effec-tiveness.\nOne systematic review (Paton 2010) compared the cost-effective-ness of sugammadex versus neostigmine/glycopyrrolate for rou-tine reversal of moderate or profound muscle relaxation produced by rocuronium and vecuronium. Results from included trials (Flockton 2008, Blobner 2010, Lemmens 2010, Jones 2008) in-dicate that sugammadex 2 mg/kg (4 mg/kg) produces more rapid recovery frommoderate NMBthanis achievedwith neostigmine/ glycopyrrolate. Economic assessment indicated that if the reduc-tions in recovery time associated with sugammadex in these trials were replicatedin routine clinical practice, sugammadex would be cost-effective if those reductions were achieved in the operating theatre,butnotiftheywereachievedintherecoveryroom.Review authors went on to conclude that further research is required to evaluate the effects of sugammadex on patient safety, predictabil-ity of recovery from NMB, patient outcomes, and efﬁcient use of resources. A recent Canadian study (Insinga 2016) used a dis-cretemodel-eventsimulationtoinvestigatethepotentialimpactof substituting sugammadex for neostigmine on operating room ef-ﬁciency and incidence of residual NMB. Study authorsconcluded thattheprincipalimpactforpatients managedbymoderateNMB is likely to be seen as a reduction in the risk of residual NMB and associated complications. For patients maintained at a deep level of block until the procedure is completed, sugammadex was likely to both enhance operating room efﬁciency and reduce residual block complications. Last but not least, the cost per anaesthetic case might increase in case of unrestricted use of sugammadex, as shown in a retrospective observational audit (Ledowski 2012). In conclusion, considerable uncertainties remain regarding the cost-effectiveness of sugammadex, and further investigation is needed. Currently, the cost of sugammadex is relatively high as theresultof proprietary rights. The price for thesmallestvial (100 mg/mL,2mL)inDenmarkisaround117euros.Inaddition,drug patents are set to expire on 27 January 2021 (Drugs.com). How thiswillaffecttheprice andclinical usage ofsugammadex remains to be established.\nAnotherimportantclinicalconsiderationinthechoiceofreversing agent is the risk of adverse effects.\nThe decision to use a drug is based on an overall assessment of its beneﬁts and harms. Monitoring and reporting of adverse events during a clinical trial constitutes a cumbersome and complex task involving many assumptions and choices, such as adequate blind-ing of study participants and investigators, distinction between\nadverse and serious adverse events, causality of adverse events to studydrugs,reportingbypatients,andﬁnallyconsistentandtrans-parent monitoring, coding, and reporting by investigators. Trials included in this review deﬁned, monitored, and reported adverse eventsin many differentways. Some trials (Blobner 2010; Jones 2008; Lemmens 2010) coded all adverse events and serious adverse events described by the investigator in a systematic way using theMedicalDictionary forRegulatory Activities(MeDRA). Other trials reported symptoms related to study drug administra-tion without necessarily deﬁning them as adverse events (Adamus 2011; Mekawy 2012) - an issue most often seen in meeting ab-stracts (Balaka 2011; Georgiou 2013; Kvolik 2012b) that is prob-ably due to word count restriction. Furthermore, some included trials speciﬁcally addressed causality between adverse events and study drugs by presenting not only adverse events observed re-gardless of relation to study drug but also adverse events possibly, probably, or deﬁnitely related to study drug (Blobner 2010; Jones 2008; Lemmens2010; Woo2013),althoughothersdidnotspecif-icallyaddressthisissue(Adamus2011; Castro2014; Yagan2015). Smallertrialswithfewobservedadverseeventsusuallypresentedall observed adverse events (Balaka 2011; Koc 2015; Koyuncu 2015; Yagan 2015), while bigger trials presented the most frequently oc-curring adverse events (Brueckmann 2015; Jones 2008; Lemmens 2010; Woo 2013). Additionally, some trials used blinded safety outcome assessors (Blobner 2010; Brueckmann 2015; Carron 2013; Flockton 2008; Woo 2013) incontrast toothers(Grintescu 2009; Kizilay 2016). Last but not least, very few of the included trials were designed and powered to address safety as a primary outcome (Brueckmann 2015; Rahe-Meyer 2014).\nAs explained earlier in the Methods and Results sections, overall clinical signs of postoperative residual paralysis such as inability to perform 5 second head-lift and general muscle weakness ob-served in some trials (Blobner 2010; Flockton 2008; Jones 2008; Khuenl-Brady 2010; Lemmens 2010) were regarded as adverse eventsinthisreview. Furthermore,wedecidedtoincludereported symptoms related to drug administration as adverse events, even thoughtheywerenotspeciﬁcallydeﬁnedasadverseevents,toavoid potentially dismissing good quality data because of lack of correct phrasing. We have addressed and explained under the notes sec-tion in Characteristics of included studies any discrepancy in ad-verse eventspresented in the original article and in thisreview due to deﬁnitions of adverse events or additional data about adverse events supplied through email correspondence with trial authors. Readers of medical journals and of this review need to be aware of theseissues astheyappraise thisreview andtheliterature critically. Included trials provided sparse data regarding which body weight dose calculations were based upon (i.e. ideal, correlated, or lean body weight), and we were unable to retrieve additional data that would shed light on this. As a consequence, we have regarded the weight data provided as total body weight.\nOurresultsshowanoverallsigniﬁcantlylowerriskofadverseevents inthesugammadexgroupthanintheneostigmine group(Analysis\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	37\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Data also show reduced risk of bradycardia (Analysis3.6) inthesugammadex group. However, the two groups reported many adverse reactions similarly, as pre-sented in the Results section. Results show that no cases of ana-phylaxis were reported.\nOur resultsmay not be directly applicable to all groups of patients because sugammadex may have different outcomes for patients withhigherASAclassesandforpatientswithspecialcomorbidities or systemic dysfunction.\nThesepatientsarenotrepresentedwellinthetrialsincludedinour meta-analyses, but lower risk of adverse effectsas well as sufﬁcient reversal from neuromuscular blockade may be even more beneﬁ-cial for this group of patients, and inclusion of these more fragile patients in future trials could potentially reduce the NNTB for avoidanceofadverseevents.However,thismightnotbeapplicable to all patient groups (e.g.. severe renal impairment has been dis-cussed as a possible contraindication to treatment. Sugammadex isexcretedunchanged in theurine bythe kidneys. Renal clearance of sugammadex is rapid, with most of the dose (70%) excreted withinsixhours(Golembiewski 2016).Noneoftheincludedtrials enrolled participants with renal dysfunction. However, Isik 2016 (n = 50) investigated the effects of neostigmine and sugammadex on adults of ASA I to II with normal renal function and found that both drugs may impair renal function, but sugammadex was more tolerablethanneostigmine. Apharmacokinetic study (Staals 2010) investigated thepharmacokinetics of sugammadex 2mg/kg and of rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg in 15 participants with renal failure and in 15 healthycontrols. Investigators found thaturinary excre-tion of sugammadex was reduced among participants with renal failure.Themedianquantity ofsugammadex excretedintheurine within 72 hours among participants with renal failure was 29%, and 73% in controls. Nevertheless, one has to conclude on the basis of existing evidence that studies on the use of sugammadex for patients with renal impairment are needed to examine safety, preferably with longer follow-up than 72 hours, because late renal impairment has to be addressed equally.\nSugammadex has been suspected of increasing the risk of speciﬁc adverse effects such as QTc prolongation and bleeding events (Bridion 2014). However, we found limited data from few trials in our systematic review on these variables, and presented data were ineligible for meta-analysis.\nThesummaryofproductcharacteristicsprovidedbyBridionstates that the “administration of 4 and 16 mg/kg of Sugammadex in healthy volunteers resulted in maximum and mean prolongations of the aPTT by 17% and 22%, respectively, and PT by 11%\nand 22%, respectively. These mean aPTT and PT prolongations were limited and of short duration < 30 min” (Bridion 2014). Rahe-Meyer 2014 (n = 1198) included participants undergoing hip or knee surgery and compared sugammadex 4 mg/kg versus usual care (neostigmine or spontaneous recovery). Study ﬁndings indicate that sugammadex induced limited (< 8% at 10 minutes) andtransient(<1hour)increasesinactivatedpartialthromboplas-tin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) but was not associ-ated with increased risk or severity of bleeding. Tas 2015 (n = 50) investigated the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on post-operativecoagulationparametersandbleedingafterseroplastyand demonstrated that sugammadex increased postoperative bleeding without signiﬁcantly affecting PT and aPTT values. An RCT of healthy adults reported that after administration of sugammadex at doses of 4 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg, a dose-dependent, limited, temporary, and clinically irrelevant prolongation in PT and aPTT was observed (De Kam 2014). A one-year retrospective study (n = 193) performed in participants with high risk of postoperative bleeding (laparotomy for cancer surgery requiring suction drains) did not ﬁnd sugammadex at doses of 2 and 4 mg•kg−1 to be as-sociated with increased bleeding as measured by the amount of blood found in suction drains and dressings (Raft 2011).\nHowever,uponreviewofthepublishedliterature,weareunableto refute or reject any safety concern with regard to sugammadex for patientsathighriskofbleedingduetoexistingseverecoagulopathy or due to the nature of procedures associated with high risk of transfusion because evidence is inadequate to supportor withhold any use of sugammadex.\nWefoundlimitedevidencewithregardtohaemodynamicimplica-tions of sugammadex use, but Kizilay 2016 compared the haemo-dynamic effects of sugammadex and neostigmine in participants with cardiac disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Haemody-namic parameters were more prominently increased among par-ticipants receiving neostigmine, and cardiac function was noted to be more stable among those given sugammadex. Data show no signiﬁcant differencesbetweenandwithingroupsintermsofQTc values.\nMorbidly obese patients make up a high-risk group (Gaszynski 2011), and because of their often compromised respiratory func-tion, theyare considered especiallyvulnerable toresidual curariza-tion in the postoperative period inﬂuencing respiratory function (Gaszynski 2011). Three trials (n = 161) investigated the optimal sugammadex dose per kilogram body weight; total body weight (TBW) (Foletto 2014), correctedbody weight(CBW) (Gaszynski 2011; Georgiou 2013), and ideal body weight (IBW) (Georgiou 2013). All three studies found sugammadex 2 mg/kg to be sig-niﬁcantly faster than neostigmine 0.04 to 0.05 mg/kg in revers-ing neuromuscular blockade at T2 reappearance, and in reduc-ing the risk of postoperative residual curarization (Foletto 2014; Gaszynski 2011).\nResearchers have speculated about the inﬂuence of volatile anaes-thetics and recovery times when neuromuscular blocking agents\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	38\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

However, we found no signiﬁ-cant differencesin recovery time to TOFR >0.9 when anaesthesia maintained with volatile anaesthetic (eight trials; n = 490) was compared with total intravenous anaesthetic (TIVA) (four trials; n = 381) (Analysis 1.2).\nSugammadex was speciﬁcally designed to reverse rocuronium as a non-depolarizing NMBA, as is demonstrated by most of the trials included in this review. However, two of the included tri-als (Lemmens 2010; Rahe-Meyer 2014) used sugammadex to re-vert vecuronium. Furthermore, Flockton 2008 compared sug-ammadex following rocuronium versus neostigmine following cisatracurium, and Martini 2014 compared atracurium for induc-tionandmivacuriumformaintenance versusrocuroniumforboth induction and maintenance. Two studies (Castro 2014; Sherman 2014) provided no information on the NMBA used.\nQuality of the evidence\nThis systematic review providesarobust assessment of theefﬁcacy of sugammadex because it includes a large number of trials with large numbers of participants showing a consistent direction of resultsacrossalltrialsandadditionalconﬁrmationthrough various exploratory analyses favouring the intervention for our primary outcome.\nHowever, this review also has several potential limitations, as our ﬁndingsandinterpretationsarelimitedbythequalityandquantity ofavailable evidence fromincludedRCTs. TheRCT isconsidered the most rigorous method of determining whether a cause-effect relationship exists between an intervention and an outcome. The strength of the RCT lies in the process of randomization, but several potential risks of bias in trial methods can affect results. The review authors have judged the risk of bias for each included study by using the recommended risk of bias assessment in the CochraneHandbookforSystematicReviewsofInterventions (Higgins 2011). All of our studies had at least one “high or unclear risk of bias”, and we considered the risk that trials may overestimate or underestimate the true intervention effect a serious limitation for all trials. In particular, judgements of performance risk of bias and funding risk of bias were overall high. We judged none of the included studies as having low risk of bias.\nApplicationoftheGRADEapproachenablesustoincorporaterisk of bias, directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimate, and risk of publication bias.\nThe GRADE quality of our ﬁndings ranks as moderate for our primary outcome, and from low to moderate across different out-comes. The main limiting factors that accounted for decreased quality of evidence included high risk of bias and imprecision (Summary of ﬁndings for the main comparison; Summary of ﬁndings 2; Summary of ﬁndings 3).\nWe mainly assessed the risk of bias of included trials using pub-lished data, which ultimately may not reﬂect the truth. We con-tacted all trial authors; 12 (33.3%) responded and provided fur-\nther information. Lack of reporting of some of the data may have affected our judgement on risk of bias in either direction.\nWe applied several statistical methods to explore and reduce the extent of bias, such as complete case analysis, trial sequential anal-ysis (TSA), overall methodological bias assessment, and analyses of various relevant clinical and physiological outcomes.\nApplication of TSA to our primary outcome indicates that at this stage, sugammadex appears superior to neostigmine. TSA pro-vided ﬁrm evidence in favour of sugammadex for outcomes such as recovery time from T2 to TOFR > 0.9 minutes, adverse events, andoverallsignsofpostoperativeresidualparalysis.However,none of the included trials were at low risk of bias, and as TSA cannot beadjusted forriskofbias, wedidnotcalculatethelowriskof bias adjusted information size, which ultimately affects the reliability and precision of our ﬁndings.\nEvaluatedoutcomesconsistentlyfavouredsugammadex.However, we graded the quality of evidence as moderate because of the high proportion of trialsat high risk of bias, large clinical and statistical heterogeneity,andsmallsample sizes,butwe upgradedthelevelof evidence in favour of sugammadex as indicated by TSA analyses. Onthebasisofthecriteriamentionedabove,wedeemedtheoverall GRADE quality of evidence in this review to be moderate.\nSugammadex was speciﬁcally designed to reverse rocuronium as a non-depolarizing NMBA, as most of the trials included in this review demonstrated this. However, two of the included trials (Lemmens 2010; Rahe-Meyer 2014) used sugammadex to revert vecuronium.\nPotential biases in the review process\nWe have followedthe recommendations provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions as this ofﬁcial guide describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining Cochrane systematic reviews on the effectsof healthcare interven-tions (Higgins 2011). We have adhered to this handbook in han-dling the included RCTs.\nMeta-analyses are limited by the quality and quantity of avail-able evidence. Eventhough our meta-analyses are based on a large quantity of data, results and methods for some of the included studies were not thoroughly described. Furthermore, some of the included trials were not speciﬁcally designed to address the pri-mary or secondary outcomes of this review, leading to possibly biased data. We have addressed this problem by labelling studies with high risk of “other bias”, as is shown in Characteristics of included studies, Figure 2, and Figure 6, and by downgrading the GRADE quality of evidence (Summary of ﬁndings for the main comparison, Summary of ﬁndings 2, and Summary of ﬁndings 3). Additionally, we are aware that as we have performed many analysesof speciﬁc adverseevents, theprobability of achieving sig-niﬁcant results by chance is high.\nWe used the same search strategy as was used in the original ver-sion of this review (Abrishami 2009), and we found 41 eligible\n\n\n \nEfﬁcacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults (Review)	39\nCopyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	\n\nstudies for inclusion. We cannot exclude the possibility that we may havemissed some of thepublished literaturebeyond theelec-tronic databases searched for this review. However, the 41 trials with 4206 participants included in this review appear to provide sufﬁcient data for meta-analyses, and our TSAs indicate a better safety proﬁle and clinical superiority of sugammadex compared with neostigmine for the population included in this trial. We found 20 relevant ongoing trials registered at https:// clinicaltrials.gov and three trials awaiting classiﬁcation, but none of these studies have published data within our main search up-date from 2008 to 2 May 2016. When published, these trials may change the results and conclusions of this review. However, the main strength of this update consists of the quantity of data comparing sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing NMB. The new search added eight years of research and 38 new trials to the review that was originally published (Abrishami 2009), which comprised three trials comparing sugammadex and neostigmine. Additionally, we have substantially updated and revised the meth-ods of this review compared with methods of the previous one. As a consequence, this review diverges from intended adherence to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions by not following the original protocol (Abrishami 2009) prepared for the ﬁrst version of this review (Abrishami 2009). After several discussions with the editorial team, we made the decision to split the original review in two based on the extensive number of pub-lications using various comparators, interventions, and outcome measures. Therefore, it seemed more appropriate to take the orig-inal review in a different direction and place more emphasis on safety issues and efﬁcacy. Although this may be perceived as in-troduction of post hoc analyses, review authors selected outcomes and subgroup and sensitivity analyses for this review before iden-tifyingincluded trials(search)andextracting datatominimize the risk of bias.\nwasreducedinthesugammadexgroup(Analysis 3.1; Analysis3.5). No previous publication has addressed this issue with the same rigour.\nA recent systematic review of sugammadex versus neostigmine for reversal of NMB (Abad-Gurumeta 2015) included 1553 partici-pants across 17 RCTs (all are included in this review).\nAbad-Gurumeta 2015 focused mainly on postoperative residual paralysis and drug-related adverse events (Abad-Gurumeta 2015). Review authors found thatsugammadex reducedallsigns ofresid-ual postoperative paralysis (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.71; P = 0.0004) and risk of minor respiratory events (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.80; P = 0.0034). However, they reported no differences in critical respiratory events (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.06; P = 0.06). Sugammadex reduced drug-related adverse effects (RR 0.72, 95%CI0.54to0.95; P=0.02) butdatashownodifferences in the rate of postoperative nausea or the rate of postoperative vomiting, Findings of this review were generally in line with the results of our updated review with regard to adverse and serious adverse events.\nAnother systematic review (Paton 2010), which included four tri-als(n=606),comparedsugammadexversusneostigmine/glycopy-rrolate for routine reversal of NMB with economics evaluation. Researchers found that sugammadex was beneﬁcial in terms of enhanced patient safety and increased predictability of recovery from rocuronium-induced NMB, with more efﬁcient use of the-atre time and staff. Conclusions of review authors on recovery time, adverse events, and cost-beneﬁt considerations are in line with those of our updated review.\nA U T H O R S ’ C O N C L U S I O N S\nImplications for practice\n\n\n\nAgreements and disagreements with other\nstudies or reviews\nThe original published review (Abrishami 2009) found no dif-ference with regard to adverse effects between sugammadex and neostigmine. This review found that sugammadex reduced the risk of adverse events when compared with neostigmine. We up-dated this review as of 2 May 2016 with regard to the search, addingeightyearsofresearchand38newtrials;theoriginal review (Abrishami 2009) comprised three trials. We re-ran the search on 10 May 2017. Currentlythreetrialsare awaiting classiﬁcation and 20 studies are ongoing.\nOur results on the primary outcome, recovery time, are in accor-dance with theﬁndings of allRCTs includedin themeta-analyses, astheyreﬂectsuperiorityforsugammadexasareversingagentover neostigmine. With regardtoour secondary outcomes- risksof ad-verse and serious adverse events - we found more diverging results among the included trials, although overall risk of adverse events\nInconclusion,resultsofthissystematicreviewsuggestthat,incom-parison with neostigmine, sugammadex can more rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block (NMB) regardless of the depth of the block. Sugammadex 2 mg/kg is 10.22 minutes (~ 6.6times)fasterinreversingmoderateNMB(secondtwitch(T2)) than neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg (1.96 vs 12.87 minutes), and sug-ammadex4mg/kgis45.78 minutes(~16.8 times)fasterinrevers-ing deepNMB (post-tetanic count (PTC) 1 to 5) whencompared with neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg (2.9 vs 48.8 minutes). With num-ber needed to treat for an additional beneﬁcial outcome (NNTB) of eight to avoid an adverse event, sugammadex appears to have a better safety proﬁle than neostigmine when reversing NMB. Pa-tients receiving sugammadex had 40% fewer adverse events than thosegivenneostigmine (riskratio(RR), speciﬁcallyriskofbrady-cardia (RR 0.16, NNTB 14), postoperative nausea and vomiting (RR 0.52, NNTB 16), and overall signs of postoperative residual paralysis (RR 0.40, NNTB 13) were reduced.

Its feasibility for cesarean delivery \nhas been reported in case series, case reports,12–16 and case \nstudies of high-risk mothers in whom succinylcholine was \ncontraindicated.17–19\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are few published \nstudies on the benefts to mother and/or newborn of \nrocuronium administration in a dose of 1 mg/kg compared \nwith succinylcholine 1 mg/kg for rapid-sequence induction \nof general anesthesia for cesarean delivery, and no pub-\nlished studies report the possible beneft of sugammadex \nfor active reversal of neuromuscular blockade after high-\ndose rocuronium for cesarean delivery.\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether the abil-\nity to reverse deep neuromuscular blockade with sugamma-\ndex would allow for a suffciently high dose of rocuronium \nto achieve comparable intubating conditions with succi-\nnylcholine in parturients undergoing general anesthesia \nfor cesarean delivery, while ensuring comparable recovery \nat the end of surgery. We hypothesized that rocuronium  \n1 mg/kg would be noninferior to succinylcholine 1 mg/kg \nfor time to tracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes were \ndifferences in intubating conditions, incidence of anesthe-\nsia perioperative complications, neonatal outcome, and the \ntime from surgical skin closure to tracheal extubation.\nMETHODS\nStudy Oversight\nTwo university hospitals participated in this randomized, \nsingle-blinded (parturient), parallel-group, controlled study \nto compare the effect of rocuronium and succinylcholine \nduring rapid-sequence induction for cesarean delivery. The \ntrial was designed by the principal academic investiga-tor in cooperation with members of the study group. The study is reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (http://www.consort-statement. org/) statement.20,21 Before patient enrollment, it was reg-istered in ClinicalTrials.gov database with the identifer: NCT01718236, October 30, 2012. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committees of both centers (University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic; and University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic).\nThe University Hospital in Brno is a perinatal center for the region of South Moravia with the population of almost 1.2 million people and >6000 deliveries per year (rate of cesarean delivery 22%; 30% of these under general anesthesia). The University Hospital in Olomouc is a peri-natal center for the Olomouc region with an approximate population of 650,000 people and >2600 deliveries per year (rate of cesarean delivery 31%; 55% of these under general anesthesia).\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nAll women aged 14 to 60 years admitted to the obstetric ward in Brno or Olomouc University Hospital for delivery were eligible to participate in the study. Inclusion criterion for enrollment was cesarean delivery scheduled under general anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were as follows: indicated and performed neuraxial blockade, anesthesiolo-gist or obstetrician opposition to patient inclusion, allergy or intolerance to ≥1 of the study drugs or known allergies or reactions to iodine, and patient refusal or no written informed consent. Discontinuation criterion was failure of TOF Watch SX (Organon, Oss, The Netherlands) measure-ments during the induction of general anesthesia.\nEach parturient who met the inclusion criteria was approached for study participation on admission to the delivery ward. All participating women provided informed consent on the day of cesarean delivery (intrapartum cesarean delivery) or on the day before (scheduled cesar-ean delivery). After written informed consent, they were stratifed into 8 groups defned by center, type of cesarean delivery, age, and body mass index. Randomization to the intervention (ROC) or control (SUX) group was performed after the decision was made for cesarean delivery by the anesthesiologist according to the study randomization scheme (see below).\nObserved Parameters\nDemographic details of the parturient and newborn, medi-cal history, indication for cesarean delivery, preanesthetic examination, important event times, total procedure time (end of administration of the propofol to tracheal extuba-tion), surgery duration time (skin incision to last stitch), intubating conditions assessed using the modifed Viby-Mogensen Scale22 (resistance to laryngoscopy, position of vocal cords, laryngoscopic view, and response to intuba-tion attempt; rated by the attending anesthesiologist), and intraoperative complications (including regurgitation, aspi-ration, vomiting, diffcult airways, oxygen desaturation, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, and hypotension, among others) were recorded on the case report form by the 15 anesthesiologists involved in the study (12 fully certifed \n \nMay 2016 • Volume 122 • Number 5 www.anesthesia-analgesia.org 1537\nCopyright © 2016 International Anesthesia Research Society.

During anesthesia, electrocardi-\nography, heart rate, SpO , noninvasive blood pressure, and \n2\nend tidal carbon dioxide (etco ) values were monitored and \n2\nrecorded in the anesthesia record.\nNeuromuscular blockade depth was measured using \nTOF Watch SX device (Organon) stimulating the ulnar nerve \non the left distal forearm; the response of adductor pollicis \nmuscle was evaluated using accelerometry. The calibration \nwas performed under IV anesthesia before muscle relax-\nant administration and lasted 10 seconds. The single-twitch \n(ST) 1-Hz mode was used during induction of neuromuscu-\nlar blockade with standardized amplitude for both groups. \nIntubation was attempted when the ST was 10% (ST 10%). \nThe level of deep nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade \nwas measured by the post-tetanic count (PTC) mode and shal-\nlow and recovering nondepolarizing blockade by TOF count \nor ratio mode. In the ROC group, sugammadex reversal was \nadministered when the PTC was ≥1. Low-dose sugammadex  \n(2 mg/kg) was administered if the TOF count was ≥1 and \nhigh-dose (4 mg/kg) was used for deeper neuromuscu-\nlar blockade (PTC ≥1). We used an Aespire S/5 anesthesia \nmachine (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI). Intraoperative event \ntimes were recorded by a nurse by pressing the Snapshot \nbutton on Datex Ohmeda S/5 Monitor (Datex Ohmeda, \nMadison, WI) and then written into the case report form.\nObstetric Protocol\nPfannenstiel supracervical laparotomy and Geppert uterot-\nomy were used in all cases. Abdominal wall closure was pro-\nvided in 5 layers, and skin closure was performed with suture.\nStatistical Analysis\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary end point of this study was the time from induc-\ntion of anesthesia to tracheal intubation. The interval was \nmeasured from the end of administration of the propofol (the \nsyringe was emptied) to the frst wave of etco appearance \n2\nafter successful tracheal intubation. All drugs were admin-\nistered through the catheter hub of the rapidly running \n18-gauge IV catheter inserted in the upper arm. The primary \nhypothesis of this study was that rapid-sequence induction \nof general anesthesia using propofol and rocuronium for \ncesarean delivery is noninferior to the combination of pro-\npofol and succinylcholine. Secondary outcomes were differ-\nences in intubating conditions, incidence of intraoperative \nanesthesia complications, neonatal outcomes, and the time \nfrom the completion of surgical skin closure to tracheal extu-\nbation. Intubating conditions were assessed using resistance \nto laryngoscopy (none, slight, and severe), position of vocal \ncords (medial, paramedial, partially abducted, and fully \nabducted), laryngoscopic view (Cormack-Lehane), response \nto intubation attempt (none, cardiovascular-blood pressure \nand/or pulse increase of 20% from baseline, and movement \nof limbs). Complications during anesthesia and the periop-\nerative period (regurgitation, aspiration, vomiting, diff-\ncult airway, oxygen desaturation, tachycardia, bradycardia, \nhypertension, hypotension, pulmonary embolism, amniotic \nfuid embolism, hysterectomy, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, \nshortness of breath, pulmonary edema, and others) were \nrecorded. Neonatal outcome was evaluated using Apgar \nscores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes assessed by an experienced neo-natologist and umbilical artery blood gas analysis.\nRandomization\nStratifed block randomization was used for generating the subject allocation sequence. Stratifcation was performed on the basis of participating center, type of cesarean deliv-ery (intrapartum or scheduled), age (<30 or ≥30 years), and \n2\nbody mass index (<30 or ≥30 kg/m ). For each stratum, the statistician generated the random allocation sequence for the 2 treatment groups. A computer random number generator was used to randomly select permuted blocks of 4 patients and an equal allocation ratio. Sequentially numbered con-tainers were used for individual strata and group assign-ments were concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes. Each envelope was opened imme-diately before the induction of general anesthesia, and the patient was assigned to either the ROC or the SUX group.\nStatistical Methods\nThe criterion for noninferiority with respect to time needed to tracheal intubation was considered to have been met if the upper limit of a 2-sided 95% confdence interval (CI) for the absolute difference between groups was not >20 seconds (assumed to be approximately one-third of the expected interval for intubation attempt start after administration of the neuromuscular-blocking agent). For this setting, a popu-lation of 214 patients was required for 90% certainty that the higher limit would be below the noninferiority margin of 20 seconds. The sample size estimation was performed accord-ing to Julious.23 We decided to include 240 patients to take into account patients who could not be evaluated.\nStandard frequency tables and summary statistics (means, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) were used to describe the baseline demographic and clinical character-istics. The Fisher exact test was used for analysis of intubat-ing conditions and complications during anesthesia, during the perioperative period and for neonatal outcome evalu-ation. Differences in the procedure times were assessed using the Mann-Whitney test. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. To examine the infuence of intrapartum cesarean delivery, the neona-tal outcomes of ROC versus SUX groups were evaluated separately in the scheduled cesarean deliveries. For second-ary outcomes, a P value <0.05 was considered statistically signifcant. All statistical analyses were performed with R software for Windows (version 2.13.0; R Development Core Team, Statistics Department, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, http://www.r-project.org/).\nRESULTS\nWe enrolled 240 parturients (ROC, n = 120; SUX, n = 120) during the study period from December 2012 to December 2013. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials dia-gram for the study is shown in Figure 2. Basic demographic characteristics of parturients are shown in Table 1.

The most important fnding was the noninferiority of \nrocuronium 1 mg/kg for rapid-sequence induction compared \nwith succinylcholine 1 mg/kg; however, rocuronium was \nassociated with a brief delay in the time from end of surgery \nto tracheal extubation. The mean time to achieve the frst wave \non etco curve was 3 seconds longer in the ROC group, a dif-\n2\nference that likely has no clinical signifcance.\nAbouleish et al.11 frst described the use of rocuronium \nfor cesarean delivery using a standard dose of 2 times the \n50% effective dose (ED ) dose (0.6 mg/kg). These authors \n95\nreported longer onset time of rocuronium (98 seconds) than succinylcholine (60 seconds). They also reported good intubating conditions in 90% of cases 80 seconds after rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg administration. In another study, Abu-Halaweh et al.8 reported good/excellent intubating conditions in 95% of patients 60 seconds after rocuronium 1 mg/kg and in 97% of patients after succinylcholine 1 mg/kg  administration. We opted to use 3 times the ED dose  \n95\n(1 mg/kg) to shorten the rocuronium onset time in accor-dance with the results of the study by Magorian et al.24 We found a shorter mean onset time than that found by Abouleish et al.11 for the ROC group (59 seconds) and good intubating conditions in both groups, comparable to that reported by Abu-Halaweh et al.8 These results support the view that rocuronium 1 mg/kg is superior in this setting to \n \nMay 2016 • Volume 122 • Number 5 www.anesthesia-analgesia.org 1541\nCopyright © 2016 International Anesthesia Research Society.

The slightly higher incidence of resistance to laryn-\ngoscopy in the SUX group was not signifcantly higher than \nthat in the study by Abu-Halaweh et al.8 However, this crite-\nrion is infuenced by the attending anesthesiologist, because \nevaluation of resistance to laryngoscopy is subjective.\n25, \nIn comparison to the recent study by Sakurai et al. we \nachieved the ST 10% later in the ROC than in the SUX group \n(59 vs 42 seconds), but there was a substantial difference in \nthe time evaluation. Sakurai et al. measured the time from \nthe administration of rocuronium to loss of visible twitch, \nwhereas we measured time from end of propofol adminis-\ntration to ST 10%, including the time needed for calibration \nof TOF Watch SX (10 seconds). This contributed to a longer \nmeasured onset time. Based on a study by Baraka,6 time to \noxygen desaturation <95% during late pregnancy after pre-\noxygenation in the supine position is almost 3 minutes. For \nthis reason, a 10-second delay has limited clinical relevance. \nThis may explain the absence of severe oxygen desaturation \n<90%, even in cases in which the time to achieve ST 10% \nwas long (maximum was 258 seconds in SUX group).\nThere was a signifcant difference in the incidence of low \n1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, but not 10-minute scores. \nHowever, if intrapartum cesarean deliveries are excluded \nfrom the analysis, where nonhomogenous signs of fetal \nhypoxemia between groups were observed (more frequent in \nthe ROC group), no differences in neonatal outcome (Apgar \nscore, umbilical blood pH) between groups were found. \nWilliamson et al.14 reported a 66% incidence of initial Apgar \nscore <7, whereas, in our ROC group, this was far less fre-\nquent (22.9%). Rocuronium has been demonstrated to have \na 16% rate of placental transfer, which might be signifcant if \nthe mother received 3 times the ED dose.11 A future study is \n95\nneeded to correlate cord blood concentrations of rocuronium with Apgar scores and neonatal twitch monitoring.\nWe found a longer total procedure time in the ROC group compared with the SUX group. However, the surgery time was comparable between groups. The explanation for this may be because of the strict study protocol that precluded administration of sugammadex until a PTC count of >0 was detected. More than 56% cases in the ROC group did not achieve a PTC count of >0 at the end of surgery. Another fnding was that >85% cases in the ROC group did not achieve a TOF count of >0, that is, the neuromuscular block-ade would not be reversible with cholinesterase inhibitors in these cases. Rocuronium administered at 3 times the ED \n95\nproduced deep neuromuscular blockade that was longer than the surgery time. This is in agreement with the results by Pühringer et al.13 and Williamson et al.14 case series in which just 1 parturient of 25 had ≥3 twitches on the TOF at the end of the surgical procedure. The clinical implication is that sugammadex may be a necessary part of rocuronium use if 1 mg/kg is used for cesarean delivery.\nThe optimal dose of rocuronium and sugammadex has been discussed extensively for the nonpregnant popula-tion.26 For simplicity, and also in accordance with manufac-turer recommendations, we chose a dose per actual body weight resulting in a median sugammadex dose of 4 mg/kg.  An important fnding was that sugammadex did not need to be administered in repeated doses because of signs of residual curarization or reoccurrence of muscular blockade in any of the parturients.\nWilliamson et al.14 reported a prospective noninterven-tional study (n = 18) with rocuronium administered in a \n \n1542   www.anesthesia-analgesia.org ANeStheSiA & ANAlgeSiA\nCopyright © 2016 International Anesthesia Research Society.

This \nprotocol resulted in deep neuromuscular blockade at the \nend of the procedure in all parturients, which was therefore \nreversed by sugammadex 4 mg/kg.\nShibusawa et al.15 presented a series of 13 female patients \nwho were given thiopental 3.5 mg/kg and rocuronium \n0.9 mg/kg. The reversal of neuromuscular blockade was \nachieved with sugammadex 2 mg/kg irrespective of the \ndepth of neuromuscular blockade, followed by repeated \nadministration every 3 minutes until a TOF ratio of >0.9 \nwas reached. Repeated administration was chosen only in \n1 patient with renal failure, who did not achieve reversal of \nmuscle power to TOF ratio of >0.9, even after >10 minutes \nand after repeated doses of sugammadex 2 mg/kg. Štourač \net al.12 presented 6 cases of high-risk parturients who \nreceived rocuronium and sugammadex. They also reported \na single sugammadex dose of 200 mg, despite varying depth \nof neuromuscular blockade.\nThere was a signifcant difference in myalgia incidence \nbetween groups; this is not surprising because myalgia is \na well-described complication of succinylcholine admin-\nistration.27 Nauheimer et al.,16\n in a case series of 10 female \npatients, investigated adverse events after rocuronium-\ninduced neuromuscular blockade in a dose of 1.0 mg/kg \nand subsequent reversal using sugammadex 4 mg/kg. \nThese authors observed only insignifcant adverse events, \nsuch as sore throat (30%) and myalgia (10%), similar to the \nresults of our study.\nAn advantage of our study is the randomized design \nusing stratifed block randomization. The study groups \nwere homogeneous, and adherence to study protocol was \nstrict, as shown in Figure 1. Another advantage is the inclu-\nsion of both intrapartum and scheduled cesarean deliver-\nies. This is important because general anesthesia is reserved \nmainly for emergency cesarean delivery.\nThe frm protocol precluding sugammadex administra-\ntion during deep neuromuscular blockade (PTC 0) is the main \nlimitation of the study; however, this is standard procedure \nin routine clinical practice. We waited until PTC 1 appearance \nin >56% of cases (median 10 minutes) in the ROC group. This \nexplains the longer duration of procedure in the ROC group. \nThis limitation can be overcome by using the approach by \nShibusawa et al.15\n with the administration of sugammadex 2 \nmg/kg every 3 minutes until adequate reversal of neuromus-\ncular blockade, irrespective of the depth of blockade.\nGeneralizability may also be limited for practices that do \nnot maintain neuromuscular blockade with a nondepolar-\nizing muscle relaxant after recovery from succinylcholine. \nBut in some countries, such as the Czech Republic, it is com-\nmon to ensure good conditions for surgical fascia and skin \nclosure.10 An additional major limitation is that the study \nwas not double blinded. This is important for evaluation \nof subjective complaints after 24 hours. In reality, a double-\nblinded study design in these settings and real clinical con-\nditions is very diffcult to ensure. We aimed to enroll both \nscheduled and intrapartum cesarean deliveries regardless of \ntime of day. During the night shift, only 1 anesthesia team \nwas in attendance in the delivery suite in both centers. We \nalso considered that the limitations of a double-blinded \ndesign in these settings would be visible fasciculation after \nsuccinylcholine administration and rapid recovery from suc-cinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade. For these rea-sons, we decided to use a single-blinded design. To mitigate the effect of anesthesia provider awareness of group assign-ment, all times were recorded by a research nurse, and man-agement followed a strict protocol directed by accelerometry measurement.\nIn conclusion, rocuronium for rapid-sequence induction was found to be noninferior to succinylcholine with respect to the time to tracheal intubation but was accompanied by more frequent absence of laryngoscopy resistance and lower incidence of myalgia than succinylcholine for cesar-ean delivery under general anesthesia.

To pinpoint its presumed anticoagulant site of action, the authors assessed Sugammadex’s impact on a \npanel of coagulation assays.\nMethods: Sugammadex, Rocuronium, Sugammadex and Rocuronium combined, or saline were added to blood samples from \nhealthy volunteers and analyzed using plasmatic (i.e., aPTT, thrombin time, and fibrinogen concentration) (n = 8 each), PT \n(quick), activities of plasmatic coagulation factors, and whole blood (extrinsically and intrinsically activated thromboelastom-\netry) assays (n = 18 each). Furthermore, dose-dependent effects of Sugammadex were also assessed (n = 18 each) in diluted \nRussel viper venom time (DRVVT) assays with low (DRVVT1) and high (DRVVT2) phospholipid concentrations and in a \nhighly phospholipid-sensitive aPTT assay.\nResults: Sugammadex increased PT (+9.1%; P < 0.0001), aPTT (+13.1%; P = 0.0002), and clotting time in extrinsi-\ncally (+33.1%; P = 0.0021) and intrinsically (+22.4%; P < 0.0001) activated thromboelastometric assays. Furthermore, \nactivities of factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII decreased (−7%, P = 0.009; −7.8%, P < 0.0001; −6.9%, P < 0.0001; and \n−4.3%, P = 0.011, respectively).

To pinpoint its presumed anticoagulant site of action, the authors assessed Sugammadex’s impact on a \npanel of coagulation assays.\n \nMethods: Sugammadex, Rocuronium, Sugammadex and Rocuronium combined, or saline were added to blood samples from \nhealthy volunteers and analyzed using plasmatic (i.e., aPTT, thrombin time, and fbrinogen concentration) (n = 8 each), PT \n(quick), activities of plasmatic coagulation factors, and whole blood (extrinsically and intrinsically activated thromboelastom-\netry) assays (n = 18 each). Furthermore, dose-dependent efects of Sugammadex were also assessed (n = 18 each) in diluted \nRussel viper venom time (DRVVT) assays with low (DRVVT1) and high (DRVVT2) phospholipid concentrations and in a \nhighly phospholipid-sensitive aPTT assay.\n \nResults: Sugammadex increased PT (+9.1%; P < 0.0001), aPTT (+13.1%; P = 0.0002), and clotting time in extrinsi-\ncally (+33.1%; P = 0.0021) and intrinsically (+22.4%; P < 0.0001) activated thromboelastometric assays. Furthermore, \nactivities of factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII decreased (−7%, P = 0.009; −7.8%, P < 0.0001; −6.9%, P < 0.0001; and \n−4.3%, P = 0.011, respectively). Sugammadex dose-dependently prolonged both DRVVT1 and the highly phospho-\nlipid-sensitive aPTT assays, but additional phospholipids in the DRVVT2 assay almost abolished these prolongations. \nTrombin time, a thromboelastometric thrombin generation assay, clot frmness, clot lysis, fbrinogen concentration, \nand activities of other coagulation factors were unaltered. Rocuronium, Sugammadex and Rocuronium combined, and \nsaline exerted no efects.\nConclusion: Sugammadex signifcantly afects various coagulation assays, but this is explainable by an apparent phospho-\nlipid-binding efect, suggesting that Sugammadex`s anticoagulant efects are likely an in vitro artifact. (Anesthesiology \n2016; 124:1277-85)\n \nSUGAMMADEX (Bridion®; \nMSD, Te Netherlands) is \nconsidered the frst representative of a drug class called \n“selective relaxant binding agents.”1 It has been reported to \nbe biologically inactive and highly selective for steroidal neu-\nromuscular blocking agents without signifcantly binding to \nplasma proteins.2,3 Furthermore, isothermal titration calori-\nmetric analyses suggested that only few substances commonly \nused during or shortly after anesthesia have the potential for \ndisplacement interactions (i.e., the binding of other molecules \nto Sugammadex instead of Rocuronium or Vecuronium).4\n \nNevertheless, concerns regarding Sugammadex’s selectivity \nhave been raised by studies in healthy volunteers and surgical \npatients that demonstrate efects of Sugammadex on coagula-\ntion as suggested by prolonged activated partial thromboplas-\ntin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) assays.5,6\n Tese \npresumed anticoagulant efects of Sugammadex and concerns \nregarding potential allergic reactions have hitherto prevented \napproval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nWhat We Already Know about This Topic\n•	Sugammadex	prolongs	activated	partial	thromboplastin	time	\nand	potentially	other	laboratory	coagulation	tests,	although	\nthere	is	no	bleeding	associated	with	this	in vitro	fnding,	and	\nthe	mechanism	of	this	effect	is	not	well	understood\nWhat This Article Tells Us That Is New\n•	Sugammadex	affects	various	coagulation	assays	by	the	\nbinding	of	phospholipids	by	the	cyclodextrin	molecules,	and	\nthis	represents	an	in vitro	artifact	observed	in	commercial	\nphospholipid-dependent	assays	such	as	the	activated	partial	\nthromboplastin	time\nData on Sugammadex’s impact on coagulation are lim-\nited to few plasmatic coagulation assays (i.e., aPTT and PT, \nand anti-factor Xa assays)5–7 8\n and platelet function testing, \nlimiting the understanding of this drug.\nAccordingly, to elucidate this issue and to pinpoint \nSugammadex`s potential site of anticoagulant action, we \n \nSubmitted for publication July 1, 2015.

For plasmatic and whole \nblood coagulation assays, venous blood (60 ml) was drawn \nfrom healthy volunteers. All subjects had a negative his-\ntory for bleeding and prothrombotic diathesis and denied \nthe intake of any medication that might have infuenced \ncoagulation. Women who could not rule out pregnancy were \nnot included. After venous puncture, the tourniquet was \nremoved in order to avoid venous stasis and blood was drawn \ninto tubes containing sodium citrate (capacity 3,000 μl;  \nMonovette, Germany). After blood sampling, tubes were \nstored at room temperature and processed within 30 min.\nMeasurements\nStandard coagulation assays, assessment of coagulation fac-\ntor activities (factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and \nXIII, respectively), and DRVVT assays were performed \nusing a BCS® XP or BCS® Analyzer (both from Siemens \nHealthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH, Germany) and \ncommercially available assays, as appropriate. Specifcally, \nDade® BC Trombin, Dade® Inulin®, Dade® Actin®, \nand \nMultifbren® U assays (all from Siemens Healthcare Diag-\nnostics Products GmbH) were used for thrombin time, PT, \naPTT, and fbrinogen measurements, respectively. Activities \nof coagulation factors II, V, VII, and X were derived from \nPT measurements using the Dade® Inovin® -\n assay, after dilu\ntion of the plasma samples with commercially available stan-\ndard human plasma defcient of the respective coagulation \nfactor (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH). \nSimilarly, activities of coagulation factors VIII, IX, XI, and \nXII were derived from aPTT measurements using Dade® \nActin® assays and standard human plasma defcient of the \nrespective coagulation factor (Siemens Healthcare Diagnos-\ntics Products GmbH). Factor XIII activity was assessed using \nthe chromogenic Berichrom F XIII® assay (Siemens Health-\ncare Diagnostics Products GmbH). LA1 Screening Reagent \nand LA2 Confrmation Reagent (Siemens Healthcare Diag-\nnostics Products GmbH) were used for the DRVVT1 and \nDRVVT2 measurements, respectively. Te TriniCLOT HS \naPTT (Tcoag, Ireland) was used as a second phospholipid-\nsensitive assay in series 2, as recommended by the Interna-\ntional Society on Trombosis and Hemostasis guidelines for \nthe detection of phospholipid-binding antibodies.9\nTromboelastometric measurements were performed \naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions using three \nrotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) delta devices \n(TEM® International GmbH, Germany) and commercially \navailable thromboelastometric assay activated using tissue \n®\nfactor, phospholipids, and calcium chloride (EXTEM ; \nTEM® International GmbH) and thromboelastometric \nassay activated using ellagic acid, phospholipids, and calcium \n® ®\nchloride (INTEM ; TEM International GmbH).

Te following ROTEM® variables were \nassessed: clotting time (CT), clot formation time, maximum \nclot frmness (MCF), and clot lysis index 60 min after ini-\ntial clotting. Details on the ROTEM® device, measurement \nvariables, and assays used can be found elsewhere.10\nTo assess thrombin generation, another thromboelasto-\nmetric whole blood assay, using minimal tissue factor activa-\ntion and using 20 μl of diluted EXTEM® reagent (1:2,000 \ndilution with HEPES bufer) as an activator, was performed \nas described by Sørensen et al.11 For these assays, CT and the \narea under the curve of the frst derivative of the thrombo-\nelastometric trace plotted against time were obtained. Mea-\nsurements were recorded for 60 min.\nExperimental Protocols\nStandard coagulation assays and analyses of coagulation \nfactor activities were performed in citrated plasma samples \nobtained by centrifuging whole blood samples at a relative \ncentrifugal force of 1,040g for 10 min using a Rotina 48R \nCentrifuge (Firma Hettich, Germany). To serve as a con-\ntrol, 400 μl saline was added to one tube. To assess drug \nefects, either Sugammadex alone (200 and 200 μl saline; \nfnal Sugammadex concentration: 130 μg/ml), Sugammadex \n(200 μl, fnal concentration: 130 μg/ml) and Rocuronium \n(200 μl, fnal concentration: 32.5 μg/ml) combined, or \nRocuronium (200 μl 200 μl saline, fnal Rocuronium con-\ncentration: 32.5 μg/ml) were added to the tubes containing \ncitrated whole blood before centrifugation.\nTo assess drug efects on ROTEM® variables, 10-fold \nsmaller amounts of either drug and/or saline were added \ndirectly to the measurement cups before measurements, in \norder to achieve the same fnal concentrations and a similar \ndegree of hemodilution.\nDiluted Russel viper venom time assays and the Trini-\nCLOT HS aPTT analyses were performed in platelet-poor \nplasma. After addition of either 400 μl of saline (control) or \n400 μl of Sugammadex and additional saline as needed (total \nvolume again 400 μl; fnal concentrations: 16.25, 32.5, 65, \nand 130 μg/ml, respectively) to the tubes containing whole \nblood samples, the samples were centrifuged at a relative cen-\ntrifugal force of 3,080g for 10 min. Afterward, about three \nfourth of the supernatant underwent the same centrifuga-\ntion process for a second time. Tree quarters of the resulting \nsupernatant were then used for the coagulation assays.\nStatistical Analysis\nData were analyzed using Prism 6 for Mac OS X, Version 6.0b \n(GraphPad Inc., USA). Based on a previous study elaborating \non the efect of Sugammadex on aPTT and PT measurements, \na sample size of 8 was considered to be sufcient to detect \nsignifcant efects of Sugammadex on coagulation assays.5 \nNormal distribution of data could not be demonstrated \nusing a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with Dallal and Wilkinson \napproximation to Lilliefors’ method. Accordingly, nonpara-\nmetric Friedman tests with Dunn adjustment of the α-error \nwere used for statistical analyses. Data are shown as median \n(25th/75th percentile) and mean percentage as compared to \nthe respective controls, with P values adjusted for the number \nof statistical comparisons performed. Values of DRVVT1 and \nDRVVT2 assays at the various Sugammadex concentrations \nwere compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, consider-\ning an adjusted a priori α-error P value of 0.01 as statistically \nsignifcant in order to account for multiple testing.\nResults\nEffects on Plasmatic Coagulation Assays\nAddition of Sugammadex but not of Rocuronium or of \nSugammadex and Rocuronium in equimolar amounts sig-\nnifcantly prolonged the PT (quick) and aPTT measure-\nments. Trombin time and fbrinogen concentration (Clauss \nmethod) were not signifcantly afected by the addition of \neither drug or their combination. Data on the efects of \nadministration of Sugammadex, Rocuronium, and Sugam-\nmadex and Rocuronium combined on the results of the plas-\nmatic coagulation assays are shown in table 2.\nSpecifcally, addition of Sugammadex resulted in a sig-\nnifcantly decreased PT (quick) (74.5 [65/86]; −16.4%; \nP < 0.0001) as compared with controls (91.5 [83/99.25]). \nIn contrast, addition of Rocuronium alone (91 [81.8/99]); \n+0.4%) and of Rocuronium and Sugammadex (91 \n[83.8/99]; +0.8%) combined did not signifcantly afect \nthe PT. In a similar way, addition of Sugammadex alone \n(30.6 s [29.8/21.5]; +13.1%; P = 0.0003) resulted in sig-\nnifcant prolongation of the aPTT as compared with con-\ntrols (27 [26.4/28.3]). Addition of Rocuronium alone (27.2 \n[26.8/28.5]; +1.1%) and of Rocuronium and Sugammadex \ncombined (27.6 [26.3/28.5]; +1.3%) did not exert signif-\ncant efects on aPTT measurements.\nEffects on Thromboelastometric Variables\nAddition of Sugammadex to citrated human whole blood \nresulted in a signifcant prolongation in CT in EXTEM® and \nINTEM® assays, while MCF and clot lysis in EXTEM® assays \nwere not signifcantly afected by either drug or their combi-\nnation. Furthermore, neither CT nor the area under the curve \nof the frst derivative of the thromboelastometric trace plot-\nted against time were signifcantly afected by the addition of \nSugammadex, Rocuronium and Sugammadex, or Rocuronium. \nData on the efects on ROTEM® variables are shown in table 2.\nSpecifcally, addition of Sugammadex resulted in a pro-\nlonged CT in EXTEM® assays (61 [56/71]; +33.1%; \nP = 0.0028) as compared with controls (49 [47/57]). Addi-\ntion of Rocuronium alone (48 [45/55]; +4.3%) and com-\nbined administration of Sugammadex and Rocuronium \n(49 [43/55]; +1.3%) did not signifcantly afect CT. In \nINTEM® assays, CT was signifcantly prolonged by the addi-\ntion of Sugammadex (196 [183/214]; +22.4%; P < 0.0001) \nas compared with controls (165 [150/177]) but not by addi-\ntion of Rocuronium alone (173 [155/179]; +4.4%) or by \n \n\n \nAnesthesiology 2016; 124:1277-85 	1279 	Dirkmann et al.\n \nCopyright © 2016, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

Since one of the \nmain diferences between plasmatic and whole blood assays \nobviously is the presence of platelets in whole blood and since \nplatelets play a major role in thrombin generation, inhibi-\ntion of platelet function by Sugammadex could be a possible \nexplanation.15,16 However, Sugammadex (4 mg/kg) has no \nsignifcant efects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation as \nassessed by impedance aggregometry.8 Our data using whole \nblood thromboelastometric assays rule out major efects of \nSugammadex on platelet function, fbrin polymerization, and \nplatelet–fbrin interaction as MCF was unaltered.\nSince CTs of both extrinsically and intrinsically activated \nassays were prolonged by Sugammadex, we expected either \nan inhibitory efect of Sugammadex on one or more factors \nof the common coagulation pathway (i.e., factors II, V, and \nX) or on at least one factor in both the extrinsic and intrinsic \npathways.17 However, activities of factors II (prothrombin), \nV, and X were unafected by Sugammadex. A direct throm-\nbin inhibitor efect (anti-IIa-efect) could be ruled out as \ncausative for our observations by unafected thrombin time \nand a whole blood thrombin generation assay.11 In addition, \na relevant anti-Xa activity of Sugammadex has been ruled \nout previously.7 Furthermore, assessment of coagulation \nfactor activities revealed that only factors of the so-called \nintrinsic pathway (i.e., factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII) and rep-\nresented only in aPTT measurements but not in PT assays17 \nshowed slight but signifcantly reduced activities after addi-\ntion of Sugammadex. In contrast, activities of plasmatic \ncoagulation factors located in the so-called extrinsic and \ncommon pathways (i.e., factors II, V, VII, and X) were not \nmarkedly decreased by Sugammadex. However, it has been \ndemonstrated that defciency of a single coagulation factor \nafects aPTT measurements only if the activity of the factor \ndecreases below 40% and afects PT measurements only if \nthe activity decreases below 20%, respectively.18 Terefore, \nalthough combined defciencies of two or more coagulation \nfactors may act synergistically,18 the observed decrease in \nactivities of only four coagulation factors exclusively located \nin the intrinsic pathway, which is less than 8% (4.3 to 7.8%), \nseemed insufcient to explain the marked prolongations in \naPTT and INTEM® CT and cannot be a causative for the \nefects of Sugammadex on PT and EXTEM® CT. Efects \non contact activation such as evoked by kallikrein inhibitors \nseem unlikely since inhibitors of contact activation do not \nalter extrinsically activated coagulation assays.19,20\nConsidering diagnostic pathways and prolongations in \nboth aPTT and PT assays17 and ruling out inhibitor-like efects \non specifc coagulation factors, as well as thrombin inhibition, \nwe decided to perform a second series of experiments search-\ning for a phospholipid-binding efect of Sugammadex similar \nto that observed in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. \nAccording to the recent International Society on Trombosis \nand Hemostasis guidelines, at least two phospholipid-sensitive \nassays, based on diferent principles, must be prolonged for \nthe diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibodies.9 Furthermore, \nanother assay with an increased phospholipid concentra-\ntion is recommended for confrmation. As demonstrated by \nour data, both a highly phospholipid-sensitive aPTT assay \nand a DRVVT assay with low phospholipid concentration \n(DRVVT1) were prolonged by the addition of Sugammadex \nin a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a higher phospho-\nlipid concentration in another DRVVT assay (DRVVT2) sig-\nnifcantly mitigated this efect and decreased CTs compared \nwith those in the DRVVT1 assay, unmasking a phospholipid-\nbinding efect of Sugammadex.\nTis fnding perfectly aligns with the observations made \nusing coagulation assays in our study.

Terefore, it is reasonable \nthat these latter assays are afected by the phospholipid-bind-\ning efect of Sugammadex. Systematic thromboelastometric \nmeasurements in patients with lupus(-like) anticoagulants or \nantiphospholipid syndromes are not available. However, in \na single patient sufering from antiphospholipid syndromes \nand undergoing cardiac surgery, CTs were prolonged before \ncardiopulmonary bypass both in EXTEM® ® \n and INTEM\nassays,22 and, similar to that in our study, CTs in EXTEM® \nassays was more prolonged than the CTs in INTEM® assays.\nTe observed decrease in coagulation factor activities also is \nfully in line with an antiphospholipid efect of Sugammadex. \nAll coagulation factor activities except the activity of factor \nXIII are assessed using either the aPTT or the PT assays and \ncalibrated normal plasma defcient of the specifc coagulation \nfactor being assessed. Terefore, all coagulation measurements \ndependent on phospholipids and infuenced by antiphospho-\nlipid antibodies will be afected by Sugammadex as well.\nA thorough review of the literature reveals that bind-\ning of various phospholipids to cyclodextrins has been \ninvestigated. Using a fexible docking algorithm based on \nmolecular mechanics, binding of phosphatidylinositol, \nphosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine to α -,  \nβ -, and γ-cyclodextrins was simulated, and stable complexes \ndriven by van der Waals forces were considered possible.23\n \nAlthough these simulations did not investigate the modifed \nγ-cyclodextrin Sugammadex, these fndings seem consistent \nwith our fndings regarding an antiphospholipid efect of \nSugammadex. Of special importance, all the phospholipids \nincluded in these molecular simulations are a constituent in \nthe thromboplastins and partial thromboplastins of coagula-\ntion assays.24,25\nOur study has some limitations. First, our data are derived \nfrom an addition of Sugammadex in vitro. However, as all \ncoagulation assays are performed ex vivo and Sugammadex \ndoes not undergo metabolization after IV injection, our results \nseem to be transferable to an in vivo situation. Furthermore, \nthe frst part of our study investigated only one concentra-\ntion of Sugammadex. However, since we searched for hints \nfor elucidating the mechanism by which Sugammadex afects \n“coagulation,” it seemed appropriate to base our calculations \non the highest dose used clinically to detect any relevant efects. \nFinally, although high phospholipid concentrations signif-\ncantly and markedly decreased Sugammadex-evoked prolon-\ngation in DRVVT assays, CTs did not fully return to control. \nTis is likely due to a fxed concentration of phospholipids even \nin the so-called “confrmatory” DRVVT assay. Since coagula-\ntion time of whole blood not containing Sugammadex did not \ndifer between DRVVT assays with high or low phospholipid \nconcentrations, there appears no alternative explanation but a \nphospholipid-binding efect exerted by Sugammadex.\nIn conclusion, while Sugammadex signifcantly afects \nvarious coagulation assays, our data reveal that these efects are \nlikely to be exerted by the binding of phospholipids contained \nin such assays. Accordingly, Sugammadex’s presumed antico-\nagulant efects are likely to just represent an in vitro artifact \nobserved in commercial phospholipid-dependent assays.\nAcknowledgments\nSupport was provided solely from institutional and/or \n departmental sources.\nCompeting Interests\nDrs.

Sugammadex alone at low, medium or high clinical\ndoses has no effect on anesthetic depth as assessed by\nEntropy and BIS or on hemodynamics.\nKeywords Sugammadex   Anesthesia   Depth   Entropy  \nBispectral Index   Hemodynamics\n1 Introduction\nSugammadex, a c cyclodextrin, reverses the variable\ndegrees of neuromuscular block produced by rocuronium and vecuronium and enhances their elimination rate [1].\nSeveral studies suggest that along with reversal of the\nneuromuscular block, sugammadex also decreases the\ndepth of anesthesia. This effect has been demonstrated for the doses of 200 mg and 4 mg/kg which are recommended for reversal of moderate or deep neuromuscular block [2, 3]. Also doses of 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg of the drug given 3, 5, or 15 min after 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium decreased the\ndepth of anesthesia in about one-ﬁfth of anesthetized\npatients compared to the control group [4].\nNeuromuscular block has been associated with decreased\nanesthetic requirements [5]. A possible explanation is that the muscle stretch receptors send signals via muscle affer-ents stimulating arousal centers in the brain [6]. Therefore\nreversal of neuromuscular block restores the proprioceptive\ninput arising from these receptors, arousing so the brain.\nOther investigators reported conﬂicting data on the effect of\nreversal of neuromuscular block on the depth of anesthesia [7]. As sugammadex does not penetrate the intact blood\nbrain barrier, it is expected to be devoid of central or\nperipheral neural and muscular effects, when given alone.\n \n123\n \n298 J Clin Monit Comput (2017) 31:297–302\n \nThe cardiovascular safety proﬁle of sugammadex when administered to reverse the neuromuscular block induced by rocuronium has been assessed in cardiac and noncardiac patients [8, 9]. However, as our study investigates the effect of sugammadex alone on depth of anesthesia, a possible lightening of anesthesia is assumed to be accom-panied by increases in heart rate and blood pressure.\nOur hypothesis was that sugammadex alone adminis-tered at the recommended clinical doses will not affect the Entropy values, BIS values, hemodynamics, pulse oxime-try and end-tidal CO during moderate, deep and intense\n2\nneuromuscular block.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of sugammadex alone, at doses applicable to the clinical setting, on state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE) and BIS, as well as on hemodynamics excluding the effects produced by the reversal of neuromuscular block. For this reason a benzylisoquinoline neuromuscular blocker was used.\nGroup-4 (G4) received 4 mg/kg of sugammadex when a PTC 1-3 appeared. These patients received the same vol-ume of normal saline 3–5 min after cis-atracurium injec-tion when PTC was 0, and also when two of the four responses of the TOF appeared.\nGroup-16 (G16) received 16 mg/kg of sugammadex 3–5 min after cis-atracurium injection when the PTC was 0. The patients received an equal volume of normal saline when a PTC 1-3 was obtained and also when two of the four responses of the TOF appeared.\nTo assure blinding of investigators, three identical syr-inges containing normal saline or sugammadex according to group allocation were prepared for each patient. The syringe barrel was covered with tape and labelled as ‘‘PTC 0’’, ‘‘PTC 1-3’’ and ‘‘TOF 2’’ by a nurse not involved in the study. The syringe volumes were calculated as if contain-ing sugammadex at the appropriate dose, according to the group. This way all syringes seemed identical to the blin-ded anesthesiologist involved in the study.\n \n\n \n2 Patients and methods\nThe study was approved by the Research and Ethics Com-mittee of Aretaieio University Hospital Athens, Greece (No R-150/03-08-10) and was registered in the ClinicalTrials.-gov registry under the number NCT01301261. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients partici-pating in the study. The study followed the CONSORT guidelines.\nPatients of both sexes, aged between 30 and 80 years with physical status ASA I-III, scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were eligible for this prospective, ran-domized, double blind study. The ﬁrst patient entered the study on December 29, 2010 and the last patient on April 24, 2014.\nExclusion criteria were hypertension, central nervous system disease and treatment with antihypertensive drugs, sedatives, tranquilizers or other central nervous system depressants, thus factors which might inﬂuence measure-ments of the primary and secondary outcomes of the study. Other reasons for exclusion were severe hepatic or renal impairment.\n2.1 Randomization and blinding\nPatients were randomly assigned to three groups of 20 patients each, by means of a computer generated program.\nGroup-2 (G2) received 2 mg/kg of sugammadex when a count of two responses of the train of four (TOF) appeared. The patients received an equal volume of normal saline 3–5 min after cis-atracurium injection (when PTC was 0) and when a post-tetanic count (PTC) 1-3 appeared.\n2.2 Anesthetic technique and monitoring\nPremedication was omitted. All patients received stan-dardized anesthesia with fentanyl 2 lg/kg and thiopental 4–5 mg/kg for induction, followed by cis-atracurium 0.2 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation and provide surgical muscle relaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoﬂurane in an oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture and incremental doses of fentanyl 2–4 lg/kg. Sevoﬂurane inspired concentration was adjusted to maintain BIS and Entropy values between 40 and 50. After that, all mea-surements were performed under steady-state conditions of anesthesia.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG), non invasive arterial blood pressure (systolic—SAP- and diastolic—DAP), heart rate (HR), pulse oximetry (SpO ) and end-tidal CO (ETCO )\n2 2 2\nwere monitored through the procedure using the S/5 Anaesthesia Monitor, (Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki Finland). The S/5 Entropy-Module of the above Anesthesia Monitor was used for monitoring the SE and RE as evaluative parameters of the anesthetic depth. The SE mainly includes components from the electroencephalogram (EEG) and is determined at a frequency range of 0.8 and 32 Hz, while RE registers frontal electromyography (EMG) and EEG and operates at a frequency range between 0.8 and 47 Hz [10]. Depth of anesthesia was also assessed by BIS monitor (BIS A-2000; Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA) connected to a BISTM sensor attached to patient’s forehead. Both Entropy and BIS provide dimensionless numbers (from 0 to 100), with higher values denoting wakefulness.\nNeuromuscular transmission monitoring of the adductor pollicis muscle was also implemented. The TOF-Watch \n \n123\n \nJ Clin Monit Comput (2017) 31:297–302	299\n \n\n \nSX acceleromyograph (Organon Ltd, Dublin, Ireland) was used. Two surface electrodes were attached to the volar area of the wrist over the ulnar nerve. After induction of anesthesia the transducer of the acceleromyograph was calibrated by pressing the appropriate button for more than 1 s. The TOF response (2 Hz stimulus of 0.2 ms dura-tion—at 60 mA-delivered every 15 s) and PTC were recorded every 3 min until a 25 % recovery of TOF was obtained. Skin temperature in the adductor pollicis muscle was also recorded every 3 min. The appropriate dose of sugammadex and the relevant two placebos according to group allocation were administered as indicated by the degree of the neuromuscular block (moderate, deep or intense).\nWhen a 25 % of TOF was obtained the study protocol was accomplished and a second dose of cis-atracurium depended upon the surgery demands, and was given at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. At the end of surgery residual neuromuscular block was reversed by neostigmine with atropine according to the clinical practice imple-mented in our department.\n2.3 Measurements\nThe SE, RE, BIS, SAP, DAP, HR, SpO , ETCO , inspired\n2 2\nand end-tidal sevoﬂurane concentration (SEVOinsp and SEVOet, respectively) and temperature of the palmar sur-face of the hand were recorded as soon as a PTC 0 number was obtained after the cis-atracurium injection (baseline) and every 3 min thereafter up to a 25 % TOF recovery. Immediately after baseline recordings the ﬁrst syringe labelled ‘‘PTC 0’’—containing sugammadex or normal saline according to group allocation—was administered to the patient.\nThe SE was deﬁned as the primary outcome while RE, BIS, SAP, DAP, HR and SpO were the secondary end-\n2\npoints of the study.\n2.4 Power calculation and statistical analysis\nInitial sample size estimation showed that approximately 20 patients were needed in each group to detect a clinical difference of SE by 20 % with a power of 0.80 and level of signiﬁcance of 5 %.\nTo assess differences in patients’ characteristics between the three treatment groups, Kruskal–Wallis Test for non-normally distributed responses was carried out. A linear mixed model on the logarithm was ﬁt in order to assess treatment differences over time. This model has time and treatment as ﬁxed effects and a random effect for subject in order to allow for correlation between repeated measurements on the same individual. In all the above models, an interaction term between time and treatment\nwas also included in order to assess whether the differences\nbetween two treatment groups were constant over time. If a\nsigniﬁcant effect was to be found, post hoc comparisons\n(adjusted for Bonferroni correction) would be carried out to\nassess at which point in time the two groups were signiﬁ-cantly different.\n3 Results\nThe three groups did not differ with regards to age, body\nweight or height (Table 1). The patients underwent gyne-cological or bowel surgery; the distribution of surgical\nprocedures in each group is shown in Table 1. Of the 60\npatients enrolled in the study, one patient in G4 group and one patient in G16 group did not complete the study. The\nexcluded patients, the dropouts and the reasons are pre-sented in the ﬂow diagram (Fig. 1).\nThe overall mean values of SE, RE, BIS, SAP and DAP, HR, SpO , ETCO , SEVOinsp and SEVOet in the groups\n2 2\nG2, G4 and G16 that received the three different doses of\nsugammadex were similar (p [ 0.05 for all comparisons, Table 2). Also, comparisons over time between the three\ngroups (G2 vs. G4, G2 vs. G16, and G4 vs. G16) regarding the SE, RE, BIS, SAP, DAP, HR and SpO revealed no\n2\nsigniﬁcant differences (Tables 3, 4).\n4 Discussion\nThe results of the present study demonstrate that sugam-madex when given alone in the absence of neuromuscular\nblock reversal does not affect the depth of anesthesia as\nassessed by entropy and BIS monitoring. Hemodynamics\nremained also unchanged.\nSeveral studies support or refute the hypothesis that\nneuromuscular blockers change the depth of anesthesia, therefore reversal of neuromuscular block would also\naffect the anesthetic depth in the opposite direction. In\nhumans pancuronium has been shown to decrease halo-thane requirements [5]. Reversal of neuromuscular block\nproduced by atracurium in patients anesthetized with\npropofol and remifentanil increased the BIS and middle-latency auditory evoked potential values [11]. Sparr et al. [4] in a study of early reversal of deep rocuronium-induced\nneuromuscular block by sugammadex reported clinical\nsigns of inadequate depth of anesthesia and increases in BIS values in about 20 % of patients after sugammadex\nadministration, although depth of anesthesia was not a\nvariable included in the study protocol. In another study\nwith total intravenous anesthesia, the reversal of rocuro-nium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex or\nneostigmine resulted in increased BIS values [3].\n \n123\n \n300 J Clin Monit Comput (2017) 31:297–302\n \nTable 1 Patients’					\n	G2	G4	G16	Statistic	p\ncharacteristics in the G2, G4					\n	n = 20	n = 19	n = 19		\nand G16 groups who received 2,					\n4 and 16 mg/kg sugammadex				2	\nAge (years)	49 ± 11.0	47 ± 13.9	49 ± 11.5	V = 0.607	0.738\nrespectively					\n				2	\nWeight (kg)	67 ± 12.7	65 ± 10.5	64 ± 9.9	V = 0.720	0.714\n				2	\nHeight (cm)	166 ± 6.6	164 ± 7.6	161 ± 5.3	V = 0.714	0.054\n \n\n \nType of surgery			\nGynecological surgery	n = 12	n = 10	n = 11\n \n\n \nBowel surgery	n = = 9n\n	8n = 8\n \nValues are expressed as mean ± standard deviation\n \nFig. 1	The ﬂow diagram of the	\n		Assessed for Eligibility (n = 76) \nstudy		\n \nExcluded (n = 16) \n1.

Nevertheless, changes in entropy and BIS values, as well as changes in hemodynamics and hemoglobin saturation should be attributed to reasons other than sugammadex itself.\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that sugammadex alone does not affect the depth of anesthesia or patient hemodynamics in contrast to sugammadex given for reversal of the neuromuscular block produced by rocuro-nium or vecuronium.\nAcknowledgments The authors thank Mrs. Aikaterini Dimitriou for helping in the statistical analysis of the data.\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConﬂict of interest The authors declare that they have no conﬂict of interest.\nReferences\n1.

Introduction\nIn pediatric anesthesia, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA)arefrequentlyusedtofacilitatetrachealintubation [1],positivepressureventilation,andoptimalsurgicaloperat-ingconditions[2].Recently,somepublicationsinadults[ –6]\n3\nhave found that deep neuromuscular blockade signifcantly improves intra-abdominal space and surgical working con-ditions throughout laparoscopic procedures. However, the use of NMBA exposes the patient to the well-described risk of residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) [7]. In adults, many studies have estimated the risk of RNMB to range anywhere from 3.5% to 83% [8]. In children, however, the availabledataisextremelysparse[2]withjustonepublication investigating the matter within the last decade [9]. Te risks associated with RNMB are commonly underestimated by anesthesiologists, even though the pathophysiological\nconsequences of residual paralysis may be severe [8]. Te use of NMBA has been associated with an increased risk for respiratoryadverseeventsinchildrenundergoinganesthesia, particularly in the postoperative period [10], as well as with more direct impairments of lung function [11].\nIt was the aim of this prospective audit, therefore, to identify the rate and severity of RNMB at our tertiary pediatric center.\n2. Methods\nEthicsapprovalwasgrantedforthisprojectfromthePrincess Margaret Hospital Ethics Committee (457 QP) and recog-nized by the Human Research Ethics Ofce of the University of Western Australia (RA/4/1/5966). Written informed con-sent was waived since this audit was classifed as a quality of care audit due to its purely observational character.\n \n2 Anesthesiology Research and Practice\n \nAll children undergoing elective or urgent surgery under general anaesthesia requiring an endotracheal tube and receiving NMBA at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, Western Australia, during the time period from 11/9/2011 to 12/16/2011 were targeted forthisaudit. Exclusions included patients operated on outside normal working hours (Monday to Friday 8a.m. to 6p.m.), emergency procedures, children who were not planned to be extubated in the operating theatre, and infants under 12 months who were too small for the available monitoring electrodes to be attached.\nData recorded included basic demographic information, as well as preexisting medical conditions and preoperative medications,datarelatedtosurgeryandanesthesia(i.e., type of surgery, time of surgery and anesthesia, method of anesthesia,andNMBAused),andadverseeventsrecordedin thepostoperativeacutecareunit(PACU).\nAttheendofthesurgicalprocedureandwhentheattend-ing anesthesiologist deemed it safe to extubate the child, the train-of-four (TOF) ratio was assessed by an independent researcher using acceleromyometry (TOF Watch; Organon Teknika;Durham,NorthCarolina,USA)viaasupramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve. In the interests of patient safety, the results of this assessment were disclosed to the attending anesthesiologist immediately prior to extubation. However, the choice of whether or not to reverse the patient pharmacologically and when to extubate the patient was lef to the attending anesthesiologist.\nAfer tracheal extubation, children were transferred to the PACU, where adverse events (postoperative nausea and vomiting, severe pain, severe coughing, stridor/obstruction, broncho- or laryngospasm, and oxygen desaturation) were recorded by the attending nurses.\n2.1.SampleSizeandStatisticalAnalysis. Tesamplingperiod was not determined by a formal sample size calculation but simply by the desire to capture data over the equivalent of 1 calendar month [12].\nSubsequently, all data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 19 (IBM; Armonk, NY; USA). To compare the incidence of RNMB between diferent groups of patients, the Chi-square test was used. ANOVA was used to compare data between patients with or without TOF ratios of <0.9. � was set at 0.05. Data are displayed as mean (SD).\n3. Results\nDuring the 5-week study period, a total of 94 tracheally intubated children were screened for inclusion in this audit. Ofthose94children,30childrenwereexcludedasnoNMBA was subsequently given in these cases.\nData of 64 children (8.2 (5.9)yrs; 35.1 (22.6)kg) were analyzed.\nPatient characteristics and NMBA details are provided in Table 1.\nTe administration of an additional intraoperative dose of NMBA was given following a request for prolonged neuromuscular paralysis by the surgeon in all cases.\nNeuromuscular monitoring was not routinely used (total �=15(23.4%); TOF �=14 �=1such\n;PTC ),\nTable1:Patientcharacteristics(ASA:AmericanSocietyofAnesthe-siology, NMBA: neuromuscular blocking agent); total � =64.\nI: 34\nASA category (�) II: 20\nIII: 10\nGeneral: 24\nOrthopedic: 7\nUrology: 11\nProcedure (�) ENT: 5\nPlastics: 4\nEye: 2\nOther: 11\nElective: 44\nUrgency (�)\nUrgent: 20\nAtracurium: 41\nRocuronium: 15\nNMBA on induction (�)\nSuccinylcholine: 6\nVecuronium: 1\nAtracurium: 10\nRocuronium: 2 NMBA during maintenance (�)\nVecuronium: 1\nMivacurium: 1 that, in 49 children, the attending anesthesiologist used no neuromuscular monitoring at all.\nReversal was deemed to be required (by attending anes-thesiologist) in 33 (51.6%) children.

However, at the time of independent TOF assessment immediately prior to tracheal extubation, 7/31 of those children had a TOF ratio <0.9 with 2 having a TOF ratio <0.7 (individual TOF ratios directly prior to extubation 34, 65, 75, 83, 85, 88, and 89, resp.).

Franklin Dexter,', 'recovery, PACU, post anesthesia care unit', 'Can J Anesth', '2018-04-26', 'Purpose There is little knowledge about how hospitals can best handle disruptions that reduce post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) capacity. Few hospitals in Japan have any PACU beds and instead have the anesthesiologists recover their patients in the operating room. We compared postoperative recovery times between a hospital with (University of Iowa) and without (Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital) a PACU.\nMethods This historical cohort study included 16 successive patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery with endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia, at each of the hospitals, and with the hours from OR entrance until the last surgical dressing applied C two hours. Postoperative recovery times, deﬁned as the end of surgery until leaving for the surgical ward, were compared between the hospitals.\nResults The median [interquartile range] of recovery times was 112 [94-140] min at the University of Iowa and 22 [18-29] min at the Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital. Every studied patient at the University of Iowa had a longer recovery time than every such patient at Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, P \\ 0.001). The ratio of the mean recovery times was 4.90 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 4.05 to 5.91; P \\ 0.001) and remained comparable after controlling for surgical duration (5.33; 95% CI, 3.66 to 7.76; P \\ 0.001). The anesthetics used in the Iowa hospital were a volatile agent, hydromorphone, ketorolac, and neostigmine compared with the Japanese hospital where bispectral index monitoring and target-controlled infusions of propofol, remifentanil, acetaminophen, and sugammadex were used. Conclusions This knowledge can be generally applied in situations at hospitals with regular PACU use when there are such large disruptions to PACU capacity that it is known before a case begins that the anesthesiologist likely will need to recover the patient (i.e., when there will not be an available PACU bed and/or nurse). The Japanese anesthesiologists have no PACU labour costs but likely greater anesthesia drug/monitor costs.', '-------------------', '', 'Time to recovery after general anesthesia at hospitals with and without a phase I post-anesthesia care unit; a historical cohort study.pdf');

It can be used to determine the timing of tracheal intubation, to adjust the level of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) to the needs of the patient and the type of surgery, to guide the use of NMBA1\nreversal agents, and to prevent residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB).\nThe only reliable method of measuring neuromuscular function is to stimulate an accessible peripheral motor nerve and measure the evoked response of the skeletal muscle thus innervated. Response can be assessed either mechan-ically and electrically (quantitative monitoring) using, for example, mechanomiography (MMG) (evoked muscle contraction), electromyography (muscle action potential),\nand acceleromyography (AMG) (thumb acceleration), or by visual or tactile means (subjective or qualitative monitor-ing). Although MMG at the adductor pollicis is the gold standard, it is impractical in routine surgical practice.2 Nev-ertheless, all quantitative NMB measurement methods are validated in relation to MMG.3,4\nTargets\nThe following objectives were established for our study:- To compare and validate the neuromuscular relaxation\nvalues obtained with TOF-Cuff (modiﬁed pressure cuff\nwith stimulation electrodes) against those obtained with\nMMG (control method) during reversal of NMB (main vari-\nable).\n \n562	G. Veiga Ruiz et al.\n \n\n \n- To compare and validate the non-invasive blood pressure\nmeasurements (NIBP) obtained with the TOF-Cuff device\nagainst invasive blood pressure measured in the radial\nartery.\n- To verify that the TOF-Cuff does not cause injuries or side\neffects.\nMaterial and methods\nA single-centre, open label, case-controlled clinical trial in 32 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia in the supine position lasting at least 30 min and requiring administration of NMBAs.\nThe TOF-Cuff device was also validated for NIBP monitor-ing compared to invasive blood pressure at the radial artery (control method) in an additional study in 17 patients. This study was conducted after the foregoing trial.\nThe study was approved by the hospital’s Clinical Research Ethics Committee (EC 2013-03 TOF-CUFF-01.doc) and was conducted between October 2013 and March 2014.\nInclusion criteria: patients age 18---65 years, ASAI-III, who had previously given their consent by reading and signing the information sheet.\nExclusion criteria: patients who refused to give informed consent; patients with concomitant disease that could prevent adherence to study protocol; patients with pre-dicted difﬁcult airway; pregnant women; lactating women; patients receiving drugs that affect neuromuscular transmis-sion.\nThe study consisted of 2 visits: a screening visit that coincided with the preoperative visit, and on the day of surgery, which included pre-anaesthesia workup, anaes-thesia follow-up, and a post-anaesthetic visit in the PACU.\nOn the day of surgery, NMB was monitored simultane-ously with the TOF-Cuff method and MMG (control method), placing the TOF-Cuff with the electrodes on the brachial plexus at humeral level, and the MMG on the contralateral arm (Fig. 1).\nDuring anaesthesia induction, both methods were used simultaneously to evoke muscle response, according to the following pattern: single twitch (ST) delivered at a frequency of 1 Hz for 1 min, followed by automatic\ncalibration to determine the intensity of the supramax-imal stimulus, and then periodic TOF stimulation every 20 s with an intensity 5 mA higher than the supramaxi-mal stimulus. At that time, the NMBA intubation dose was administered, and endotracheal intubation was performed at maximum blockade. TOF stimulation was continued throughout the intervention, and post-tetanic count was applied manually during the deep NMB phase (TOF = 0), at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist. At the end of surgery, when NMB was moderate (TOF ≥ 2) o superﬁcial (TOF > 0.1), an NMB reversal agent (neostigmine or sugam-madex) was administered. At TOF = 0.9, the patients were extubated.\nThe anaesthetic technique used was: premedication with IV midazolam 1 --- 2 mg and/or fentanyl 0.5---1  g/kg−1. SatO2, NIBP, ECG and entropy were monitored. Anaesthe-sia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg−1 and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg−1, and intubation was performed when optimal conditions were achieved (TOF < 4). Anaesthesia was main-tained with sevoﬂuorane in 50% oxygen/air, with a 1---2% end-tidal concentration and a fresh gas ﬂow of 1 --- 2 L, or with target controlled infusion of propofol balanced with remifentanil at 0.1---0.2  g/kg−1/min−1, as required by each patient, to maintain the entropy level between 40 and 60. Boluses of 0.1 mg/kg−1 rocuronium were admin-istered if neuromuscular monitoring with MMG showed the need for additional relaxation. Mechanical ventila-tion was adjusted to maintain normocarbia with an end tidal CO2 of 30---35 mm Hg. After surgery, and when NMB was moderate or superﬁcial, sugammadex or neostig-mine was administered in alternate patients. Neostig-mine was administered at a dose of 0.03---0.06 mg/kg−1, while sugammadex was administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg−1.\nAfter the intervention, patients were transferred to the PACU, where they immediately underwent a preliminary evaluation for the presence of clinical signs of residual blockade, erythema, petechiae, ecchymosis or erosions on the arm where the cuff had been placed, and pain at that level was assessed using a visual analogue scale. A second and ﬁnal study evaluation was carried out at 4 h, also in the PACU.\n \nTOF-Cuff speciﬁcations\n \nThe study device consists of a modiﬁed blood pressure\ncuff attached to a portable monitor (RGB Medical Devices,\nMadrid, Spain) (Fig. 2). The cuff contains electrodes that\nstimulate the brachial plexus at the level of the humerus.\nThe electrodes are placed in contact with the skin on the\ninside of the arm, directly on the path of the nerve branches\nof the brachial plexus at the level of the musculocutaneous,\nmedian and radial nerves.\nThe portable monitor has 3 input ports for connection to\nthe TOF-Cuff, invasive blood pressure transducer and MMG,\na high resolution TFT screen for graphic and alphanumeric\ndisplay of measurements, an internal rechargeable battery,\nand an output port for exporting data to a computer.

In order to evaluate the accuracy of TOF-Cuff blood pressure values, measure-ments were taken simultaneously with the study device, using the invasive blood pressure device as the control method. Slightly over half (55%) of measurements were taken from men, and 45% from women. The mean age was 49.9 years and the mean BMI was 26.2 kg/m−2 (Table 1). Most patients were ASA II, with an arm circumference of between 25 and 35 cm, although in 2 patients the circumfer-ence was less than 25 cm and in other 2 it was greater than 35 cm.\nSystolic and diastolic blood pressure values were com-pared. Accuracy was determined by calculating the mean error and standard deviation. Table 5 shows the results obtained.\nFig. 4 shows the Bland---Altman plot for systolic blood pressure (mean error 1.6 and standard deviation 7 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (mean error −3.4 and standard deviation 6.3 mmHg).\nDiscussion\nObjective, routine monitoring of NMB is the best strategy for reducing incidence of RNMB and its associated respira-tory complications, and is widely recommended7,8 provided NMBAs9 are used. However, the practice is not widespread in routine clinical practice, mainly due to technical difﬁculties and the need to optimise surgery times, which do not take into account anaesthesia requirements. The new TOF-Cuff is an easy-to-use, inexpensive NMB monitoring device based on a modiﬁed blood pressure cuff. As it does not require immo-bilisation of the arm, it does not interfere with the surgical process.10\nThe aim of this study has been to compare 2 neuromuscu-lar monitoring methods, irrespective of other aspects such as pharmacodynamic response to the NMBA. We followed the same guidelines on monitoring depth of neuromuscular blockade used in most similar studies,1,11 and our method-ology and statistical analysis is also comparable to these papers.6,12,13\nInter-individual response to NMBAs varies greatly, and therefore monitoring NMB during anaesthesia induction can\n \n566	G. Veiga Ruiz et al.\n \n\n \ndetermine the best moment to perform intubation. It also allows anaesthetists to adjust muscle relaxation to the requirements of each patient and each type of interven-tion. In order to avoid complications, patients should only be extubated once neuromuscular function has been recovered after surgery.14\nThis study complements the study carried out in 2005 by Rodiera et al. comparing a prototype TOF-Cuff device with a control method (MMG) for neuromuscular monitoring. The authors found a high correlation between both methods.10\nA TOF > 0.9 measurement on the TOF-Cuff method obtained a speciﬁcity of 91% and a positive predictive value of 84%. This is a good result, and is consistent with the values found in NMB monitoring methods currently used in clinical practice (AMG, electromyography). However, much lower values are obtained for NMB reversal (TOF = 0.7) (speciﬁcity 66% and positive predictive value 71%).\nStudies performed so far have compared the MMG method with AMG-based devices,13,15,16 which are the most widely used in routine clinical practice. These studies show a rela-tively low error but considerable variability in the recovery phase. Other studies that have compared AMG and MMG16 and AMG and electromyography12 have concluded that the same TOF ratio measured with all these devices cannot be used to detect\n RNMB, since AMG overestimates rever-sal of NMB. The authors recommend that anaesthesiologists conﬁrm complete reversal using clinical signs before extu-bating. Therefore, since our study shows that the TOF-Cuff also overestimates TOF in NMB reversal, as is the case when comparing AMG and MMG, the TOF-Cuff device could be as safe as AMG in clinical practice, although neither show the same measurements as MMG. To ensure safe extubation, both a TOF ratio of 0.9 by AMG or TOF-Cuff and an assess-ment of the clinical situation of the patient should be taken into account.\nWhen neostigmine (which is slower-acting than sugam-madex) is used for NMB reversal, TOF-Cuff measurements are even higher than measurements in patients receiving sugammadex for reversal. This could be related with the different position of the stimulation electrodes in both methods (MMG is applied to the adductor pollicis, while TOF-Cuff stimulates several muscles innervated by the brachial plexus), since these muscle groups react differently to NMBAs.17\nDue to its ease of use, simplicity and accessibility, we expect this quantitative NMB monitoring method to become more widely used, enabling such monitoring to become a part of routine surgical practice.\nNo adverse events related to the use of the TOF-Cuff, even on the skin in contact with the electrodes, were observed in our patients, and no patients reported pain after awakening.\nAccording to European standard 93/42/EEC, a pressure measuring device must be accurate to within ±5 mmHg with a maximum standard deviation ± 8 mmHg. In our study, the accuracy of the TOF-Cuff was within this range.\nConclusions\nA TOF > 0.9 quantiﬁed using the TOF-Cuff device showed good correlation with a TOF > 0.7 measured with MMG,\nsuggesting that the TOF-Cuff can safely be used in clinical practice. The ease of use and accessibility of the TOF-Cuff device could help to extend the routine use of neuromus-cular monitoring, and its use as part of standard operating room monitoring could improve patient safety by reducing the risk of residual blockage. The TOF-Cuff is also valid for measuring NIBP, and was not associated with any adverse events, skin lesions or residual pain.\nEthical responsibilities\nProtection of human and animal rights\nThe authors declare that the procedures followed adhere to the ethical guidelines of the responsible committee on human experimentation and comply with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association.\nData conﬁdentiality.

This analysis was limited to the populations of recommended sugammadex use, with those meeting the following criteria included in the creation of the model: sugammadex adminis-tered at the recommended dose for the depth of NMB (sugammadex 2.0 mg/kg at reappearance of the second twitch [T ] of the TOF [moder-\n2\nate NMB]; sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg at 1–2 post-tetanic counts [PTC] [deep NMB]; sugammadex 16.0 mg/kg at 3 min after administration of rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg [for the purposes of evaluating effects in the sit-uation of clinical need for reversal soon after single-dose rocuronium administration]; an available valid time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9; an available CL measurement.\nCR\nA 2-step approach was used to generate the model.

Also of note, while recovery time to TOF ratio of 0.9 are reported here for consistency, the primary endpoint of the pivotal study was recovery of ﬁrst twitch to 10% of baseline, which reﬂects a point at which return of function of the diaphragm, and thus ability for spontaneous respira-tion, is likely [10].\n3.2.

Discussion\nResultsofthispooledanalysisof26randomizedPhaseIIandIIIstud-iesproviderobustevidenceoftheefﬁcacyofsugammadexfortherever-sal of rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced NMB, according to 3 recommended administration schedules: 2.0 mg/kg at reappearance of T , 4.0 mg/kg at 1–2 PTC and 16.0 mg/kg at 3 min after rocuronium\n2\n1.2 mg/kg. When administered at reappearance of T , 96% and 86% of\n2\npatients receiving sugammadex recovered to a TOF ratio of 0.9 within 5 min of sugammadex administration following rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced NMB, respectively. Similarly, when administered at 1–2 PTC, 95% and 77% of patients receiving sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg recovered within 5 min, respectively. In contrast, very few patients treated with neostigmine at moderate or deep levels of NMB recovered within 5 min.\nThe results conﬁrm that sugammadex results in a clinically signiﬁ-cantly more rapid reversal of moderate and deep blockade versusspon-taneous recovery and more rapid reversal of moderate blockade versus neostigmine (Table 2). Sugammadex also resulted in a more rapid re-versalofdeepblockadeversus neostigmine,butthisisoflimitedclinical signiﬁcance given that, unlike sugammadex, studies have conﬁrmed that neostigmine cannot adequately reverse deep NMB [33].Indeed, this analysis conﬁrms earlier ﬁndings that neostigmine requires some degree of spontaneous recovery at the time of administration to be ef-fective [34], and is therefore not suitable for administration at deeper levels of NMB (1–2 PTC), whereas sugammadex is effective in reversal of deep block [4]. Although not studied in this pooled analysis, individ-ual studies have conﬁrmed that the incidence of residual NMB and\nrecurrence of NMB is low following sugammadex reversal of both rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced moderate and deep blockade [4–9,29].\nTheability of the16.0 mg/kgdoseof sugammadexto rapidlyreverse NMB when administered shortly (within 3 min) after an intubating dose of rocuronium is thebasis for its approval for use should an urgent clinical need to reverse NMB arise [35]. Fortunately, these emergency, life-threatening situations, such as when attempts to intubate have failedandthereisaneedforimmediateventilationarerareandnotpos-sible to study directly in a clinical trial. Therefore, studies to investigate the efﬁcacy of sugammadex to reverse rocuronium were designed to simulatetheseemergentsituationsascloselyaspossible,withacknowl-edgment of the limitations of a model setting to fully mimic the emer-gency situation [10,31]. Nevertheless, the results showed that 95% of subjectsadministeredsugammadex16.0mg/kg3minafterrocuronium had recovered to TOF ratio of 0.9 within 5 min after initiation of NMB, thereby indicating that this use of sugammadex reduces the risk of on-going paralysis in this setting and the potential associated risks for in-complete recovery and hypoxic brain injury. The authors acknowledge these results may vary depending on the speciﬁcs of the urgent setting, as pointed out in a manikin-based study designed to simulate an emer-gency ‘cannot intubate, cannot ventilate’ situation, in which procedural delays to prepare and administer sugammadex were observed [36].\nIn subgroup analyses, data suggest the potential for longer recovery times for sugammadex-mediated reversal of vecuronium- versus rocuronium-induced NMB; use of the former versus the latter was shown to lead to a 1.6 min (78%; [61%–98%]) longer recovery time with sugammadex. For sugammadex administration at reappearance of T , geometric mean times to TOF ratio of 0.9 were 1.9 (1.8–2.0) and\n2\n2.9 (2.5–3.4) min following rocuronium and vecuronium, respectively. Corresponding times for sugammadex given at 1–2 PTC were 2.2 (2.1– 2.3) min and 3.8 (3.0–5.0) min. However, it is important that these ob-servations be taken into appropriate clinical context, as most patients recoveredwithin5minirrespectiveoftheNMBAused,andtheserecov-ery times remain signiﬁcantly shorter than when compared with use of either neostigmine or placebo.\nSugammadex is renally eliminated, with a clearance approximating the glomerular ﬁltration rate [37]; thus exposure to sugammadex pro-gressively increases with worsening renal function. While renal clear-ance was not measured in all sugammadex studies, and when measured, renal function was based on baseline creatinine, assessment of available datashowed that patients withreduced renalclearance had only slightly slower recovery times after treatment with sugammadex in the present pooled analysis. When sugammadex was administered at routine recommended doses in patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (CL 30–b80 mL/min), an increase in recovery\nCR\ntimes of 0.4 min (20%; [9%–32%]) was observed versus those with nor-mal renal function (CL ≥ 80 mL/min). For appropriate context, it\nCR\nshould be noted that sugammadex efﬁcacy is largely dependent on C , which is unaffected by renal impairment, and because the effect\nmax\non recovery times in subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment was modest, this factor is not expected to be of clinical relevance or re-quire dose adjustment in clinical practice. However, due to limited clin-ical experience, sugammadex is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment, including those requiring dialysis [35].\nGeographical region was also shown to have an effect on recovery times following sugammadex, with those in USA/Canada experiencing a1.0min(38%;[25% 52%]) longer time to recovery, versus those in Eu-\n–\nrope/Japan. While the reasons for this effect are not entirely clear, the most plausible explanation appears to be related to the greater levels of experience in use of the TOF-Watch®\nSX in the European and Japa-nese sites compared with those in USA/Canada. Poor TOF traces tend to result in prolonged recovery times, and therefore the effect may not be reﬂectiveoftrulyslowerrecovery,butratherareﬂection of measure-menterror.However,asaveragerecoverytimesfollowingsugammadex in the American and Canadian sites were under 4 min, regardless of\n \nW.J.

For all other covariates tested in the model, including age,sex,ASAClass,raceandbodymassindex,nodemographicfactorre-sulted in nominally statistically signiﬁcant or clinically meaningful ef-fects on recovery times from NMB after sugammadex administration.\nFor methodological reasons, safety analyses were not performed on the current pooled efﬁcacy dataset, although safety has been assessed across the entire global development program to the conclusion that sugammadex was generally well tolerated in surgical patients and healthy volunteers. Potentially serious hypersensitivity reactions, in-cluding anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients treated with sugammadex; in a clinical study, anaphylaxis occurred in 0.3% (n = 1/299) of healthy volunteers (not receiving either anesthesia or an NMBA) treated with sugammadex (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02028065). Post-marketing reports of suspected hypersensitivity in surgical patients administered sugammadex have also been received since its ﬁrst launch in 2008 [38–45]. Clinical features in these reports have included dermatologic symptoms, hypotension requiring the use of vasopressors, and prolonged hospitalization and/or the use of addi-tional respiratory support.\nInthepivotalclinicalstudy,hypersensitivityreactionsdemonstrated a dose-response relationship, occurring more frequently after the 16.0 mg/kg dose versus 4.0 mg/kg and placebo (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02028065). Consequently, patients should be observed after sugammadex administration and appropriate precautions taken. In ad-dition,casesofmarkedbradycardia,someofwhichhaveresultedincar-diac arrest, have been observed within minutes after administration of sugammadex [35]. Patients should be monitored for hemodynamic changes and treated with anticholinergic agents and ventilatory sup-port, if clinically signiﬁcant bradycardia is observed. Sugammadex, at doses of 4.0 or 16.0 mg/kg versus placebo, has also been associated with dose-related increases in activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio in healthy sub-jects, although prolongations in these parameters were of a short dura-tion (i.e., ≤30 min) and considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance [46]. Based on this observation, a large prospective study (n = 1198) was performed in orthopedic surgical patients undergoing hip or knee surgeryandreceivingconcomitantthromboprophylaxistreatment,put-ting them at increased risk for bleeding complications [47]. The results of this dedicated study indicated no meaningful bleeding risk or blood loss is associated with use of sugammadex (4.0 mg/kg) in comparison with usual care. However, coagulation parameters should be carefully monitoredinpatientswithknowncoagulopathies,those receivinganti-coagulants or thromboprophylaxis drugs other than heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, or patients receiving thromboprophylaxis drugs who then receive sugammadex 16.0 mg/kg [35].\nFor the purposes of the current analysis, data regarding the time to TOF ratio of 0.9 were presented as geometric means (95% CIs). While the results provide an indication of the typical effect of sugammadex in terms of reversal of NMB in the current dataset, it is important to note that, as a result of inter-individual variability in drug response, not all patients will conform to the average reversal times reported here. Potential for more prolonged recovery has been reported in indi-vidual cases [4,19,48] and illustrate the importance of adequate moni-toring of patients receiving sugammadex (and other NMB reversal agents) to restore neuromuscular function. To this end, the judicious and routine use of objective neuromuscular transmission monitoring is recommended inorder to evaluatethe depthof blockpriorto andfol-lowing administration of NMB reversal agent, and to conﬁrm recovery from NMB prior to extubating.\nTwo recent studies have assessed the efﬁcacy of sugammadex in re-versalof small degrees of NMB (TOF ratios of 0.2 and0.5). In a study de-signed to evaluate the dose-response relationship of sugammadex and neostigmine for reversal of residual rocuronium-induced NMB (TOF ratio0.2),sugammadexatadoseof0.49mg/kgwassufﬁcienttoreverse the residual NMB to a TOF ratio of ≥0.9in95%ofpatientswithin5min\n[49]. In another study designed to determine the dose of neostigmine and sugammadex required to reverse a shallow residual NMB (TOF ratio 0.5), sugammadex 0.22 mg/kg allowed recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥0.9 in a mean of 2 min, with 95% of all patients recovering within 5min[50]. However, such low doses of sugammadex are not approved for the reversal of rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced NMB and, per the labeling for sugammadex, lower than the recommended doses of 2.0 mg/kg for routine reversal of moderate NMB and 4.0 mg/kg for rou-tinereversalof deep NMB may lead to anincreased riskof recurrenceof NMB and is not recommended [35]. Prospective conﬁrmatory trials of the safety and efﬁcacy of low-dose sugammadex would be required be-fore use in this clinical setting could be recommended through appro-priate product labeling. In this pooled analysis, we show that sugammadex administered at recommended doses (2 and 4 mg/kg) leadstorapidreversalofrocuronium-andvecuronium-inducedmoder-ate and deep NMB.\n5. Conclusions\nSugammadex administered atrecommended doses(2and 4 mg/kg) provides effective, rapid and predictable reversal of rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced moderate and deep NMB. Sugammadex 16 mg/kg also provides rapid and predictable reversal when given ap-proximately 3 min after rocuronium and is recommended if there is a clinical need to reverse NMB soon after an intubating dose of rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg).\nResults of this large pooled analysis of 26 studies demonstrate that sugammadex provides robust recovery across intrinsic factors, with minimal risk of recurrence of NMB, and thus provide further conﬁrma-tion of the labeled dose recommendations.\nAuthor contributions\nAll authors are responsible for the work described in this paper.

Keywords: Neuromuscular blockade, extubation, rocuronium, reversal\n \nIntroduction\n \nIt is a widespread belief among anaesthesiologists that the spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular blocking agents \n(NMBA) may be sufcient to avoid postoperative residual paralysis (PORP), if enough time has passed since the last \nNMBA administration. In these cases, it is assumed that pharmacological reversal may not be necessary. However, the \n \ntime course of spontaneous recovery is dependent on a multitude of factors; the duration for sufcient recovery of neu-\nromuscular transmission is difcult to predict (1, 2). Understandably, the practice of relying only on the natural decay of \nNMBA cannot be substantiated by prospective investigations for ethical reasons. Instead, it is possible to retrospectively \nanalyse rocuronium dosing patterns from electronically archived anaesthesia records with the aim to compare the dosing \npatterns of rocuronium and pharmacologic antagonists. All three diferent practices may be correct and acceptable, if, at the \ntime of extubation, the neuromuscular transmission has recovered to a train of four (TOF) ratio of at least 0.9, which in turn \nmust have been confrmed by quantitative relaxometry. In this investigation, we analysed anaesthetic records from cases in \nwhich rocuronium was antagonised with either neostigmine or sugammadex or in which rocuronium was allowed to recover \nspontaneously without reversal. Te time to reversal was compared in the context of dosing patterns over time while having \narrived at a neuromuscular function of a TOF ratio of 0.9 (3-6).\n \n	Address for Correspondence: Peter Biro       E-mail: peter.biro@usz.ch	Received : 16.06.2017   \n57		\n	©Copyright 2018 by Turkish Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Society - Available online at www.jtaics.org	Accepted : 16.10.2017    \n \nTurk J Anaesthesiol Reanim 2018; 46: 57-61\n \nMethods \nIn a single-centre, retrospective study, we extracted data from \narchived electronic anaesthesia records in which rocuronium \nwas used as the only NMBA for the entire surgical procedure, \nand at termination of anaesthesia, the TOF ratio has recove-\nred to 0.9 either with or without a pharmacological reversal. \nTe Cantonal Ethical Committee approved this investigation \n(No. 2016-01202, chaired by Peter Meier-Abt) necessitating \nthat patient data should be de-identifed to protect personal \nhealth information. Informed consent from the patients was \nnot required. To obtain comparable groups with diferent re-\nversal strategies for avoiding PORP and after performing a \npower analysis, we selected 180 of the most recent anaesthesia \nrecords that met our inclusion criteria and divided them to \nthree post hoc study groups:\n• Group N=reversal of rocuronium-induced neuro-\nmuscular block with neostigmine (n=60).\n• Group S=reversal of rocuronium-induced neuro-\nmuscular block with sugammadex (n=60).\n• Group Z=spontaneous recovery of rocuronium wi-\nthout pharmacological reversal (n=60).\nextubation. RDAC is an ideal tool to describe drug amount and time related dosage patterns. In particular, it considers the fact that drug doses given closer to the reference time have a stronger residual efect, which indicates a more pronounced residual neuromuscular weakness compared to an identical total dose per body weight and time that has been administe-red predominantly earlier during the same time frame. Te formula to calculate RDAC is as follows:\nwhere D/m is a particular bolus dose in mg/kg and ΔT is the time diference between drug application and reference time in minutes. Te numerals indicate consecutive bolus doses with 1 representing the frst bolus, 2 representing the second bolus, on and so forth.\nData acquisition and analysis\nTe extracted records were divided into the 3 post hoc study groups N, S and Z with 60 cases each. Te following demo-graphic and clinical data were collected from de-identifed patient records: \n \n\n \nTe investigated parameter was the underlying rocuronium \ndosage pattern expressed in a defned residual drug activity \ncoefcient (RDAC) at end of anaesthesia (7). In a prelimi-\nnary power analysis of the expected diferences between the \ngroups due to the duration of action variability of rocuro-\nnium, a sample size of 180 was considered sufcient.\nTe inclusion criteria were general anaesthesia with tracheal \nintubation and neuromuscular relaxation with rocuronium \nin patients undergoing elective surgery, with a duration of \nanaesthesia >60 minutes. Exclusion criteria were the use of \nother muscle relaxants and sedative drugs, such as dehy-\ndrobenzperidol or clonidine, (8) and with neuromuscular \ndiseases or other conditions that may afect neuromuscular \nfunction.\nAll the cases were performed as total intravenous anaesthesia \nwith propofol for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia \nand analgesia with fentanyl/remifentanil combinations. All \npatients were extubated at the end of surgery as per usual cli-\nnical routine, based on the anaesthetists’ clinical judgement. \nTe termination of anaesthesia was permitted as soon as the \nreturn of neuromuscular transmission has arrived at 0.9 TOF \nratio either with or without pharmacological reversal.\n• Patients’ age, gender, weight and height.\n• Duration of anaesthesia.\n• Rocuronium dosage profle (according to RDAC) \n(Biro 2013).\n• Choice of reversal agents and their dosage or non-re-\nversal.\nStatistical analysis\nTe power analysis was based on an ANOVA-test using three groups, an a-error probe of 0.05, a power of 90%, and an estimated efect size of 0.3, resulting in a total sample size of 180. Te Chi-square test was used for analysis of nominal and ordinal data. For continuous data, normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Normally distributed data were compared by one-way ANOVA, not normally dis-tributed data using Kruskal–Wallis test and multiple compa-risons were corrected using the Tukey’s or Dunn’s multiple comparison tests, respectively. A p value of <0.05 was consi-dered statistically signifcant.\nPower calculation was performed using G*Power 3.1 (G*Power, Düsseldorf, Germany) and statistical analyses were calculated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Incorp, San Diego, CA).\n \n\n \n	Determination of the individual residual drug activity 	\n		Results\n	coefcient (RDAC)	\n	To compare dosing patterns of rocuronium, we used the 	Te 180 analysed cases originated from March to Sep-\n	RDAC method, which is a pharmacometric calculation 	tember 2016 at the University Hospital Zurich.

BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:101 	Page 2 of 10\n \n\n \nBackground\nSugammadex is the first selective muscle-relaxant-binding agent that acts by forming a complex with aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., rocuronium). This results in a rapid decrease in free rocuronium in the plasma [1], and causes a shift from the acetycholine recep-tors in the neuromuscular junction, down the concentra-tion gradient into the plasma. This allows rapid and effective reversal of neuromuscular block (NMB) of any depth. Sugammadex is excreted both rapidly and virtually unchanged via the urine [1, 2], as is the rocuronium– sugammadex complex, which resembles the pharmacoki-netic features of sugammadex [1, 3, 4].\nCorticosteroids have wide applications in anaesthesiology, as they are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in patients with chronic diseases [5]. Furthermore, corticoste-roids have an important role in states of hyper-reactive airway [6], anaphylaxis [7, 8], septic shock [9, 10], and laryngeal [11], cerebral [12, 13], and surgical edema [14], and they are also used in conjunction with multimodal analgesia [15–17] and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting [18–20]. Among the corticosteroids, dexamethasone is the most commonly used for the treat-ment of oedema and analgesia, and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Structurally, dexa-methasone closely resembles the aminosteroid neuromus-cular blocking agents, and therefore concerns have been raised about possible interference of such corticosteroids in the action of sugammadex [21–24].\nThere are two types of possible interactions of drugs with sugammadex that need to be taken into consider-ation: capturing and displacement. Capturing interac-tions can occur with oral contraceptives, where their free and active concentrations can be reduced by sugam-madex coadministration to such an extent that it has the effect of missing a daily dose of contraceptives [25, 26]. Displacement potential was tested in early in vitro stud-ies by Zhang [25], where isothermal titration calorimetry showed that over 40 lipophilic, steroid, and non-steroid drugs have some potential for interactions with sugammadex, although these affinities were 120-fold to 700-fold lower than that for the aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agent rocuronium. The same method was used in the study of Zwiers et al. [26], where 300 drugs were tested and modeled to deter-mine possibile drug interacts with sugammadex. Of all of these tested compounds, only three were considered possible for the displacement of rocuronium from sugam-madex: toremifene, fusidic acid and flucloxacillin [26, 27]. According to these model-based chemical studies and the theoretical molecular features, sugammadex appears highly selective for aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents, with the minimal possibility of interactions with other drugs.\nThis study was designed to investigate the in vivo significance of previously observed in vitro interactions between dexamethasone and sugammadex [21, 22] in surgical patients undergoing general anaesthesia, where sugammadex was used to reverse rocuronium-induced NMB. To explore this potential interaction we hypothe-sized that less sugammadex is available for rocuronium binding. In agreement, the plasma rocuronium concentra-tions increases to a lesser extent after sugammadex application in patients treated with dexamethasone, in comparison to patients without dexamethasone treatment.\nMethods\nThis prospective, single-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, single-centre study was retrospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ANZCTR) and was assigned trial number ACTRN12612000245897 and universal trial number U1111-1128-5104. The study protocol was approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia (permit number 161/02/11). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients enrolled. The study was performed at the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Therapy, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia, and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines and Good Clinical Practice.\nSubject recruitment\nThe patients included were aged 18 years or more, with American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I-III, and were anesthetized for elective abdominal or uro-logical surgery for which they needed tracheal intubation and deep NMB throughout the procedure. The exclusion criteria were: lack of consent, diagnosed neuromuscular disease, anticipated difficult intubation, severe kidney failure, personal or family history of malignant hyper-thermia, known allergic reaction to any of the anaes-thetics used, pregnancy or nursing, and taking oral contraceptives or drugs already known to interact with sugammadex. The patients who complied with all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the control (granisetron) group and the observed (dexamethasone) group. Randomization was performed using random number-generator, and the allocation sequence was concealed from the researcher enrolling and assessing participants in sequentially externally numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes.\nStudy procedure\nOn arrival in the operating room, standard monitoring with pulse oximetry, capnography and electrocardiog-raphy was installed, followed by insertion of an intra-\n \nRezonja et al. BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:101 	Page 3 of 10\n \n\n \narterial cannula for invasive blood pressure measure-ment. The depth of anaesthesia was followed according to the bispectral index.\nAnaesthesia was induced with propofol (1–2 mg/kg; IV) or etomidate (2 mg/kg; IV) and fentanyl (3–5 μg/kg; IV). Before administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent, their neuromuscular transmission was assessed by acceleromyography, using a TOF-Watch® SX neuromus-cular transmission monitor (Organon Ireland Ltd, Merck and Co, Inc, Swords, Dublin, Ireland), at the ulnar nerve at 15 s intervals until stabilization. During the TOF-Watch® SX calibration period, a laryngeal mask was inserted and anaesthesia was maintained with inhaled sevoflurane (minimal alveolar concentration ≥1) in an air/ oxygen mixture with intermittent positive-pressure venti-lation of the patient’s lungs to achieve a normal end-tidal carbon dioxide (4.5–5.5 kPa). Calibration of the TOF was performed according to good clinical practice guidelines [28]. Rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg; IV) was then administered, and when an adequate depth of NMB was reached (ac-cording to TOF measurements), tracheal intubation was performed, and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation continued with sevoflurane in an air/oxygen mixture with additional boluses of fentanyl (2–3 μg/kg;IV).The NMB was further assessed throughout the procedure using repetitive TOF stimulation, and IV rocuronium 0.1–0.2 mg/kg was administered accordingly, to main-tain the desired depth of NMB. This was maintained until the reversal of NMB using sugammadex (200 mg; IV), for recovery of the T4/T1 TOF ratio to ≥0.9 at the end of anaesthesia.\nAll of the patients received an antiemetic for prophy-laxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Following intubation, the patients were randomized by the opening of an opaque envelope containing a computer-generated allocation to either control group (received granisetron (1 mg; IV) at the beginning of the operation) or dexa-methasone group – these patients received dexametha-sone (0.15 mg/kg; IV) 5 min to 10 min before the administration of sugammadex. Both prior to sugamma-dex administration and after NMB reversal to TOF ≥0.9, a blood sample (4 ml) was withdrawn from the intra-arterial line. Tubes without additives were used, the samples were centrifuged, and the serum frozen at −20 °C until analysis. Determination of plasma rocuronium and dexamethasone\nconcentrations\nThe rocuronium concentrations in the plasma samples obtained from the patients in the control and dexametha-sone groups were determined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana. For this purpose, a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated according to recent recommendations for\nmethod validation in analytical toxicology [29], which were based on the International Conference on Harmonization, Harmonized Tripartite Guideline Validation of Analytical Procedures. The sugammadex–rocuronium complex disso-ciated on the chromatographic columns during the liquid chromatography, and therefore the data for rocuronium indicate the total (captured plus free) rocuronium in the plasma.\nThe plasma dexamethasone concentrations in the samples from patients in the dexamethasone group were determined at the Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, University Medical Centre Ljubljana. A competitive colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for the analyses (ID Laboratories Inc., London, Canada), with the limit of quantification of 50 μg/l, and a within-run variability of <10 %. All of these samples were analyzed as one batch.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary study endpoint was the time from sugam-madex administration to NMB reversal, measured as the recovery of muscle strength to a TOF ratio ≥0.9. The secondary endpoints were the ratios between the dexa-methasone (test group) and rocuronium concentrations (both groups) after NMB reversal to a TOF ratio >0.9 versus the dexamethasone and rocuronium con-centrations, respectively, prior to administration of sugammadex.\nDue to the lack of available literature on blood concen-trations of dexamethasone and rocuronium, sample size was determined on the basis of previous sugammadex studies [30–34] where the mean time from moderate or profound rocuronium-induced NMB to NMB reversal with a TOF ratio >0.9 was studied. We considered a 20 % increase in the time to NMB reversal to be clinically relevant. Assuming a power of 80 % for a two-sided test of difference in proportion at the 5 % significance level, and allowing for a 10 % drop-out due to protocol violation, we calculated that 33 patients per group were required.\nThe demographic data of the control and dexamethasone groups were compared using Students’ t-tests or Mann–Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, or χ2 tests for nominal variables. For paired measurements (rocuronium and dexamethasone concentrations), paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used.\nTwo models of multiple linear regression were con-structed, the first to examine the relationship between dexamethasone and the time to reversal of the rocuronium-induced NMB with sugammadex, and the second to determine whether dexamethasone affects the ratio between the rocuronium concentrations after NMB reversal versus before sugammadex administration. Beside the group (control/dexamethasone) variable, two (depth of NMB before dexamethasone administration\n \nRezonja et al. BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:101 	Page 4 of 10\n \n\n \n(baseline TOF, with TOF 1–4) and sugammadex dose) or three (depth of NMB before dexamethasone adminis-tration (baseline TOF, with TOF 1–4), sugammadex dose and rocuronium dose per hour of operation) independ-ent variables were added in the first and second regres-sion model, respectively. To meet the assumptions of the linear regression model, sugammadex dose and rocuronium dose per hour of operation were logarith-mically transformed.\nThe effects of the time interval between the two blood samples that were withdrawn and the sugammadex dose on the ratio of dexamethasone concentrations after NMB reversal versus before sugammadex administration were assessed within the dexamethasone group using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the ANOVA model, the independent variables were categorized as follows: the patients who received 2–3 mg/kg sugamma-dex vs. 3–4 mg/kg sugammadex, and the patients in whom the time between withdrawal of blood samples was ≤5 min vs. >5 min.\nResults\nBased on the power analysis, 65 patients were randomized to either the control (granisetron) or dexamethasone group, of whom 62 completed the study per protocol (Fig. 1). One patient in the control group was excluded from the study due to a surgical complication, and technical difficulties when measuring the TOF were en-countered with two patients from the dexamethasone group. In two patients among those who completed the\nstudy (one in the control and one in the dexamethasone group), a TOF ratio ≥0.8 but not ≥0.9 was reached, so these two patients were excluded from further analysis.\nThe baseline characteristics of the control and dexa-methasone groups are summarized in Table 1. There were no significant differences in these parameters between the two treatment groups.\nDexamethasone effect on time to reversal of the NMB by sugammadex\nFor the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9, there were no statistically significant differences between the control (121±61 s) and the dexamethasone group (125±57 s; P =0.760).\nThe first multiple linear regression model analysed the variables predicting the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9 and included group (control or dexamethasone), depth of NMB before sugammadex administration, and sugam-madex dose (logarithmically transformed). The model was statistically significant (P =0.049) and explained about 10 % of the population variance of the outcome (Table 2). The depth of NMB before administration of sugammadex had a statistically significant negative weight (Beta = −0.268; P =0.038), which indicated that in patients with a lower baseline TOF (before sugamma-dex administration) the time to NMB reversal to a TOF ratio ≥0.9 tended to be longer. The weights for sugammadex dose (Beta= −0.237; P =0.069) and group (control versus dexamethasone group; Beta= −0.054; P =0.676) were not statistically significantly different from zero.\n \nFig. 1 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram of study cohort.

This model was statistically signifi-cant (P =0.005) and explained about 20 % of the population variance of the outcome (Table 3). Sugam-madex dose (Beta= −0.375; P =0.004) and rocuronium dose per hour of operation (Beta= −0.366; p = 0.007) were statistically significant predictors whereas the depth of NMB before sugammadex administration (Beta= −0.089; p =0.483) and addition of dexametha-sone (Beta= −0.186; p =0.131) did not statistically sig-nificantly predict the rocuronium concentrations ratio. Analysis of factors affecting plasma dexamethasone\nconcentration\nAlthough there was a statistically significant difference (p <0.001) between the dexamethasone concentrations before sugammadex administration (810 ±283 μg/l) and\nafter NMB reversal to a TOF ratio ≥0.9 (604 ±208 μg/l, Fig. 3), ANOVA did not reveal significant effects of sugammadex dose (2–3 mg/kg (n =23) vs. 3–4 mg/kg (n =8); p = 0.729) or time between the withdrawal of blood samples (≤ n =12) vs. >5 min (n =19);\n5min(\np =0.524).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we have shown that previously ob-served in vitro interactions between sugammadex and dexamethasone [21, 22] are not reflected in the recovery from rocuronium-induced NMB by sugammadex in anesthetized patients.\nWe first quantified the possible binding of dexametha-sone to sugammadex by measuring the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9. Our results show, that the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9 is not delayed by the administration of dexamethasone before sugammadex reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB, which is in accordance with recent clinical studies by Buonanno et al. [24] and Gulec et al. [23]. In both of these studies dexamethasone was used for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Buonanno et al. retrospectively compared the effect of 8 mg dexamethasone at the induction of anesthesia or just before sugammadex adminstration on reversal time in adults [24] while Gulec et al. prospecitvely studied the\n \n\n \nTable 2 Summary of multiple regression analysis for variables predicting the time to TOF ratio ≥0.9 (n = 60)		\nB SE (B) β P-value F (df)	P-value	Adj.

This observation is in\nagreement with previous studies [38–40] and can indeed reversal time of sugammadex on rocuronium induced be explained by rapid rocuronium encapsulation by NMB in children who received 0.5 mg/kg of dexametha- sugammadex, which would create a concentration gradi-sone at the induction of anesthesia [23]. In comparison to ent that favours the movement of the remaining free these studies, we used low-dose fixed dexamethasone con- rocuronium away from the neuromuscular junction and centration (0.15 mg/kg) just prior to sugammadex admin- into the plasma.

Box plots for the\nmeasurements of the ratios of rocuronium and dexamethasone\nconcentrations after NMB reversal (to a TOF ratio ≥0.9) to the\nrocuronium and dexamethasone concentrations, respectively, before\nsugammadex administration, in the dexamethasone group. Data are\nmedians with interquartile range\ninto clinical practice. In co-cultures of human muscle cells innervated with rat embryonic spinal cord explants, sugammadex diminished dexamethasone effects on constitutive IL-6 secretion [21], and high dexamethasone concentrations attenuated the reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB by sugammadex [22]. We can therefore assume that in human plasma, the binding between dexamethasone and sugammadex does not promote clinically significant consequences in terms of NMB re-versal delay. There could be at least two possible expla-nations for this.\nFirst, the plasma dexamethasone concentrations determined in in vivo after low-dose dexamethasone administration (0.15 mg/kg) are lower than those used in previous in vitro studies [21, 22]. The mean plasma concentration of dexamethasone (before administration of sugammadex) was approximately five times lower than dexamethasone concentration that resulted in the peak in vitro effect (10 μM). The latter had re-portedly been reached only after high-dose dexametha-sone treatment, which can be used during cardiac surgery [22, 41–45]. Hence, the sufficiently high plasma dexa-methasone concentration might be critical for its com-plexion with sugammadex.\nSecond, under in vivo conditions, there are several physiological factors that can affect the binding between dexamethasone and sugammadex that cannot be pre-dicted by in vitro conditions. This can be substantially explained by looking into the pharmacokinetics of the drugs involved. First, the greater portion of intravenous dexamethasone, 75± 4 %, is bound mainly by albumin [46] and the remainder, the unbound dexamethasone is\ntheoretically suitable for interaction with sugammadex.\nFurthermore, the apparent volume of distribution for\ndexamethasone (normalized for 70 kg bodyweight) would be 65.7±17.3 l [47], such that expected serum concentra-tion for 70 kg person (receiving altogether 10.5 mg dexa-methasone) would be 160±61 μg/l (0.4±0.2 μM), which is considerably lower than our measured mean concentra-tion just before the reversal of NMB (810 μg/l±283 μg/l, which corresponds to 2.1 μM±0.7 μM) and mean con-centration after NMB reversal to TOF ratio ≥0.9 by\nsugammadex (604±208 μg/l, which corresponds to 1.8± 0.6 μM). We therefore assume that both blood samples\nwere drawn before steady state was reached and our aim – to achieve high plasma level of dexamethasone – was\ntherefore accomplished. This allows us to speculate about the impact of higher dexamethasone doses (that could\nconceivably be used in certain clinical conditions and that\nhave also been used in in vitro studies [21, 22]) on sugam-madex reversal of NMB. To elaborate even further we can\ntake into account the pharmacokinetic profile of sugam-madex, which has a volume of distribution similar to\nextracellular fluid (11–14 l) and it does not bind to plasma\nproteins [48]. The sugammadex dose of 200 mg for a 70 kg bodyweight theoretically results in the plasma\nconcentration of 18182 – 14285 μg/l (8.3–6.6 μM). Unfor-tunately, sugammadex plasma concentration was not\ndetermined in our study and one can only speculate\nwhether these theoretical steady-state concentrations\nreflect the actual plasma concentration, especially 2 min\nafter administration. Furthermore, as previous studies\nhave demonstrated, 2 min after administration of 2 mg/kg\nsugammadex the total (rocuronium-bound and free)\nplasma concentrations of sugammadex was about 20000–\n30000 μg/l (13.8–9.2 μM) [40, 49], which is also higher\nthan theoretical steady-state concentrations. Considering\nthese calculations, and further assuming all dexametha-sone molecules would be captured by sugammadex imme-diately after its administration, about 77–85 % of surplus\nsugammadex would still remain available for rocuronium\nbinding (expected steady-state concentration for a 70 kg\nbodyweight after receiving 0.6 mg rocuronium (mean\nvolume of distribution of 14.2 l [50]) would be 2957 μg/l, which corresponds to 5.6 μM).Finally,be-sides the high protein binding properties dexametha-sone lacks the charged quaternary nitrogen on the\nammonium group of neuromuscular blocking agents\nthat binds to the carboxyethyl side chains of sugam-madex [51]. This explains the aforementioned low\nassociation rate constant between dexamethasone and\nsugammadex (less than 1000 mol/l) in contrast to\nhigh rocuronium-sugammadex association rate constant\n(1.79×107 mol/l) [26] and further supports assumption that clinically important NMB delay due to dexametha-sone would be highly unlikely.\n \nRezonja et al. BMC Anesthesiology	(2016) 16:101 	Page 8 of 10\n \n\n \nNevertheless, we cannot extrapolate our findings on corti-costeroids in general. Namely, study by Zwiers et al. has re-vealed that dexamethasone shows the lowest displacement potential among corticosteroids [26], so based on the present and previous studies [21–24] the clinically relevant interactions between sugammadex and other corticosteroids cannot be excluded and further studies are required.\nWhen interpreting our findings, one should take into consideration the limitations of the study. As already men-tioned, sample size was determined on the basis of previ-ous sugammadex studies [30–34] instead of conducting a preliminary study. Next, the sugammadex dose was not ad-justed to depth of NMB (TOF count), but was rather gen-eralized to all patients (one vial, 200 mg), which was then later calculated to mg/kg sugammadex for statistical ana-lysis. To compensate for this, the data were analyzed using a regression model to adjust for different sugammadex concentrations. Furthermore, enrolment of another group of patients in whom NMB reversal would be promoted by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (and not by sugammadex) would have helped us distinguish between the decrement in dexamethasone concentration due to its re-distribution to peripheral compartments and to the decrement attribut-able to its complexing with sugammadex.\nRegarding the choice of the TOF ratio ≥0.9 threshold, it should be noted that we could have analyzed complete data without excluding the two patients who had not reached the threshold. The simplest approach would be to assign the maximum observed time (optionally increased by a small random value) to those two patients. A more valid approach would be to analyze the data as censored, e.g., using a Cox regression model. We tried both approaches and obtained essentially identical results to those reported (in terms of statistical significance of the model as a whole as well as of the individual predictors). The ef-fect of omitting the two patients was therefore negli-gible, so we opted for using the established threshold and applying a simpler data-analysis method.\nConclusions\nTo conclude, the addition of dexamethasone in anesthe-tized patients did not delay NMB reversal by sugammadex. Although we observed a drop in plasma dexamethasone and a rise in plasma rocuronium concentrations after sugammadex administration, this did not appear to be a direct consequence of the displacement interaction between dexamethasone and sugammadex. Therefore, the significant interaction between dexamethasone and sugammadex that has been previously demonstrated in in vitro biological models was not confirmed in anesthetized patients in vivo, probably due to several intrinsic factors that influence pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of both dexa-methasone and rocuronium. The interaction is therefore limited to such extent that is clinically irrelevant.\nAbbreviations\nANOVA: Analysis of variance; ANZCTR: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry; ASA: American Society of Anaesthesiologists; IL-6: Interlekukin 6; LC-MS/MS: Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry;\nNMB: Neuromuscular block; TOF: Train-of-four; TOFr: Train-of four ratio Funding\nThis research was funded by University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe dataset supporting the conclusions of this article is available on request by contacting the first or corresponding author.\nAuthors’ contributions\nKR designed and conducted the study, analyzed the data, drafted the\nmanuscript and is the author responsible for archiving the study files.

Respiratory complications such as pneumonia and post-extuba-tion respiratory failure represent the second most common type of postoperative complication after wound infection.1–3 More-over, post-extubation respiratory failure has been shown to be one of the most signiﬁcant factors associated with poor patient outcomes, leading to a longer hospital stay,2–4 and increased ﬁ-nancial cost.12\nNeuromuscular blockers (NMBs) are commonly used during induction of anaesthesia to facilitate intubation, and optimize surgical conditions. However use of NMBs has been associated with negative side effects, and we recently demonstrated an in-creased incidence of postoperative respiratory failure, expressed as re-intubation and unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admis-sion post-surgery, after use of intermediate-acting NMBs.5 These complications translated to a 90-fold increase in mortality,5 and are likely to have resulted from lingering effects of NMBs, leading to residual neuromuscular blockade in the recovery room. Residual neuromuscular blockade occurs in approximately 20–60% of patients at arrival in the post-anaesthesia care unit\n67and\n(PACU) , is associated with an increased incidence of post-operative hypoxemia, pneumonia, and atelectasis in the post-operative period8–10 and an increased length of stay in the PACU.6 To decrease the likelihood of residual neuromuscular blockade after surgery, intra-operative monitoring of neuromus-cular transmission may be performed, to allow the NMB to be ti-trated to the desired effect during surgery and conﬁrm recovery from neuromuscular blockade before extubation.11 Acetylcholi-nesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine may also be adminis-tered at the end of surgery, to reverse the neuromuscular blockade. However, neostigmine is unable to effectively reverse deep concentrations of neuromuscular blockade,12 and addition-ally may be associated with both nicotinic and muscarinic side effects.13 14 Furthermore, neostigmine has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative de-oxygenation and atelec-tasis.51516In contrast to neostigmine, sugammadex reverses any degree of rocuronium or vecuronium-induced blockade by encapsulating the NMB, thereby inactivating it.17–20\nWe therefore investigated whether sugammadex reduces the incidence of post-surgical residual neuromuscular blockade upon arrival in the PACU, compared with usual care.\nInstitutional Review Board of the Massachusetts General Hos-pital, Boston, MA, USA (unique identiﬁer: NCT01479764).

Patients were excluded if they used any other investigational drugs within 30 days of randomization, or participated in another clinical trial within 30 days.\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either sugamma-dex or neostigmine/glycopyrrolate. Before study activation, a sample of 200 sealed envelopes were prepared by the sponsor: 100 for the sugammadex group and 100 for the neostigmine/gly-copyrrolate group.

According to the response to train-of-four (TOF) and post-tetanic-count stimulation, two depths of neuromuscular blockade were deﬁned: moderate (TOF count 1 to 3 in response to TOF stimulation), or deep [no response to TOF stimulation; but a response to post-tetanic-count (≥1)]. Sugammadex was to be administered at a dose of 2 mg kg−1 if spontaneous recovery had reached moderate neuromuscular blockade, or at a dose of\n−1 if recovery had reached deep neuromuscular blockade. 4mgkg\nAdministration and dosing of neostigmine/glycopyrrolate was consistent with the centre’s usual care practice and according to the product label(s) for reversal, with a maximum dose of\n−1). 5 mg (that is a neostigmine dose between 17.1–84.8µgkg The appropriate timing of administration of either NMB or rever-sal agent or extubation was based on the decision of the anaes-thesiologist. A TOF ratio was recorded for each patient within 5 min of arrival to the PACU by an assessor blinded to the study treatment. The TOF-watch was calibrated in each patient before performing the measurements. The stimulation current was set to30mAandtheTOF-watchSXwascalibratedinthecalibration1 mode.21\nThisTOFratioindicatedthelevelofrecoveryfromneuro-muscular blockade at PACU entry.\nStudy endpoints\nThe primaryendpoint wasthe presence of residual neuromuscu-lar blockade, deﬁned as a TOF ratio <0.9 on arrival to the PACU.\nThe keysecondaryendpoint wasthe time from start of study medication administration, to the time the patient was ready for discharge from the operating room, deﬁned as the time point deemed by the providing anaesthesiologist medically ap-propriate for the patient to leave the operating room. Based on the standard of care at the clinical site, the patients were required to have a regular breathing pattern, with stable oxygen saturation and stable haemodynamics to be considered discharge-ready.\nExploratory endpoints relating to surgical efﬁciency para-meters were also measured.\nStatistics\nAll analyses were conducted for the intention-to-treat popula-tion, which comprised all patients who received a dose of study medication. For the primary endpoint, patients were also re-quired to have a reliable TOF ratio measurement at PACU entry for analysis.\nFor the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, the odds ratio of having residual neuromuscular blockade was analysed for sugammadex vs usual care, with the exact 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for the odds ratio and P value calculated by Pearson χ2 test.22\nFor the key secondary endpoint analysis, time from start of study drug administration to the patient being considered ready for operating room discharge, was analysed with analysis of covariance, where the assigned treatment group was the main predictor in the model, and age, ASAClass, BMI, comorbid-ity index, and length of surgical procedure were added as covari-ates. Times were log transformed before inclusion in the model, as these times are considered to follow an approximately lognormal distribution. Non-parametric analysis using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed as a secondary (sensitiv-ity) analysis. This test was also used to compare TOF values before reversal between the two groups.\nCategorical data were presented as percentage (frequency) and continuous data as mean, standard deviation (), unless otherwise speciﬁed. All time intervals were presented as geo-metric means and associated 95% CI. A sample size of 71 pa-tients per treatment group was determined to have a power of 85%, showing a signiﬁcant difference (α=0.05) in the incidence of TOF ratio <0.9 between both groups. It was assumed that TOF ratio <0.9 incidence would be 5% in the sugammadex group and 22% in the usual care group.623The investigators aimed to enrol 75 patients for both groups in case of missing data.\nAll statistical analyses and tests were performed using SAS (v 9.1.3, Cary, NC). A two-sided P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.\n \n\n \nSafety assessments	Results\n \n\n \nSafety assessments were conducted by a blinded safety assessor. Each patient underwent a physical examination at screening and at the post-anaesthetic visit (at least 10 h after administration of sugammadex or neostigmine/glycopyrrolate). Vital signs were recorded at screening. Beats min -1 and bp were recorded at regu-lar intervals and changes of >20% from baseline were considered signiﬁcant.Continuouselectrocardiogramandoxygensaturation (Sp ) monitoring were performed throughout anaesthesia and\nO2\npostoperatively, in accordance with standard clinical practice. In the PACU, vital signs were recorded on admission, at 5 min and 15 min after admission, and then every 15 min thereafter until 120 min, or discharge from the PACU. Any possible indica-tions of partial neuromuscular blockade (e.g. change in respira-tory rate or decrease in Sp level attributed to residual\nO2\nneuromuscular blockade) occurring during the time between ad-ministration of the reversal agent until PACU discharge were recorded.\nThe safety assessor, blinded to both study drug and efﬁcacy measurement results, followed-up on all patients for adverse events (AEs), and serious AEs. The assessor visited the patient in the PACU and on postoperative day 1 and followed-up with the patient 7 days after surgery, either in person or on the telephone.\nIn total, 74 patients received sugammadex and 77 patients received usual care and were included in the all-patients-as-treated analysis (Fig. 1, Table 1).\nResidual neuromuscular blockade at PACU entry\nA TOF ratio for assessment of recovery from neuromuscular blockade was obtained at PACU arrival for all patients in the su-gammadex arm (n=74) and for all patients except one in the usual care arm (n=76). This patient was admitted to ICU after sur-gery, instead of the PACU.\nA total of 33 patients had residual neuromuscular blockade at PACU entry, all of whom were in the usual care group (0% vs 43% comparing sugammadex with usual care, P<0.0001) (Fig. 2). The exact 95% CI for the odds ratio of residual neuromuscular block-ade with sugammadex vs usual care was 0.00 to 0.06. ATOF ratio of ≤0.7 at PACU entry was reported foreight (10.5%) patients from the usual care group (Fig. 2).\nSimilarly, the average level of neuromuscular blockade recov-ery upon PACU entry was signiﬁcantly higher in the sugamma-dex group compared with the usual care group, demonstrated by a mean () TOF ratio of 1.07±0.09 vs 0.90±0.17, P=<0.0001 (Fig. 3).\n \n746 | Brueckmann et al.\n \nEnrolled (n=183)\n \nDiscontinued before randomization:\n– Administrative reasons (n=3)\n– Did not meet in/exclusion criteria (n=21)\n– Withdrew consent (n=5)\n \n	Randomized (n=154)	\nSugammadex (n=76)		Usual care (n=78)\n \n\n \nDiscontinued before treatment:	Discontinued before treatment:\n– Adverse event (n=1)	– Adverse event (n=1)\n– Withdrew consent (n=1)	\n \n\n \n	Received study drug	\nn=74		n=77\n \n– Unplanned admission\n   to intensive care unit (n=1)\n \n	Primary endpoint available	\nn=74		n=76\n \nSafety assessments\n \n	1-day follow-up	\nn=74		n=77\n \n– Lost to follow-up (n=2)\n \n	7-day follow-up	\nn=74		n=75\n \nFig 1 Patient ﬂow chart (in accordance with CONSORT guidelines).\n \nGeometric mean (95% CI) times from study drug administra- (P=0.17), reversal was given either in the absence of documented tion to operating room discharge readiness were 14.7 (13.1–16.4) TOF-count or at a documented deep neuromuscular block (TOF-min and 18.6 (16.6–20.8) min, for sugammadex vs neostigmine, count 0 or 1).\nrespectively P=0.02).

In the\n \nSugammadex elimination of residual blockade | 749\n \nsugammadex group, the AE was cough, of mild intensity. In the usual care group, there were seven AEs in this class: one patient each with transient apnoea (3 min), cough, hypoventilation, ob-structive airways disorder, oropharyngeal discomfort, and two patients with rales; all of mild or moderate intensity. Findings of decreased Sp were observed for one (1.4%) patient in the su-\nO2\ngammadex group, vs two (2.6%) in the usual care group.\nNo AEs led to discontinuation of a treated patient from the study. Furthermore, no serious AEs suggestive of hypersensitiv-ity and/or suspected events of anaphylaxis were reported, and no deaths, serious trial procedure-related, or medical device-re-lated events were reported during the study.\nDiscussion\nThe use of sugammadex for neuromuscular blockade reversal at the end of surgery was shown to eliminate residual blockade at PACU admission while, in contrast, 43% of patients treated with neostigmine/glycopyrrolate had a TOF ratio <0.9 at PACU arrival, 11% even a TOF ratio <0.7. The mean () TOF ratio at PACU entry was signiﬁcantly higher in the sugammadex group, compared with neostigmine (1.07±0.09 vs 0.90±0.17, respectively; P<0.0001).\nThe TOF-Watch-derived diagnosis of residual blockade translated into clinically signiﬁcant symptoms of muscular weakness in two patients in the usual care group, considered probably drug-related by the investigator. While clinical signs ofresidual neuromuscularblock maynotalwaysbereliable,clin-ical diagnosis of postoperative muscle weakness could be attrib-uted to residual neuromuscular blockade, because signs and symptoms of muscle weakness were associated with TOF ratios of 0.53 and 0.74, respectively, at PACU arrival.21 After a total dose of 140 mg rocuronium, one patient developed signs and symp-toms of respiratory distress, 57 min after the ﬁrst administration of 3.5 mg neostigmine. The last TOF count measured and docu-mented before reversal was 0. A previous study demonstrated that the maximum effect of neostigmine reversal decreases by about 25% within an hour.25 We speculate that recurrence may have been a contributing mechanism of respiratory distress in this patient, based onthe combinationof high-dose rocuronium, development of muscle weakness one h after neostigmine, and prompt improvement of symptoms after a second dose of neostigmine.\nIn the second patient, the effects of high-dose rocuronium (150mg)wereintendedtobeantagonizedwithhighdoseneostig-mine (5 mg). For this patient a TOF-count of 2 was documented 15 min before reversal. These two patients underline the clinical relevance of residual neuromuscular blockade and the import-ance of using neuromuscular transmission monitoring, to docu-mentrecoveryofneuromusculartransmissionbeforeextubation. No patients with clinical evidence of residual neuromuscular blockade or recurrence ofneuromuscular blockadewere reported in the sugammadex group.\nThe use of modern intermediate acting NMBs has been showntobeassociatedwithanincreasedriskofpostoperativere-\n726which sidual neuromuscular blockade in the PACU, can re-present a considerable safety risk in patients recovering from surgery. Residual neuromuscular blockade has previously been shown to be present in 45% of patients arriving at the PACU, after a single dose of an intermediate-acting NMB.27 Lingering effects of NMBs may increase the risk of developing respiratory complications in the PACU, particularly in susceptible patients.5 Residualblockadeleadstodysfunctionoftherespiratorymuscles and functional impairment of the muscles of the pharynx and\nupper oesophagus, and a reduced ventilator response to hyp-\n–10 28 Traditionally, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such oxia.58\nas neostigmine have been used to reduce residual neuromuscu-lar blockade in the postoperative period. However, Grosse-Sundr-up and colleagues5 found that use of neostigmine in a real-world scenario of a busy operating room, increased the risk of oxygen desaturation in the early postoperative period.515Thismaybe at-tributable to the attempts of antagonizing deep blockade that typically result in incomplete recovery,15 as neostigmine cannot effectively antagonize deep levels of neuromuscular blockade.12 Sugammadex is not known to be associated with any respiratory complications. In contrast to neostigmine, which signiﬁcantly impaired upper dilator muscle when given for neuromuscular blockade reversal, sugammadex was associated with no such re-spiratorysideeffects.29 Sugammadexisregisteredforuseinmore than 70 countries worldwide and has been approved in the European Union since 2008. Sugammadex has been shown to result in 3 to 18 times faster reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, compared with neostigmine12 18 30 and 69 times faster vs placebo.20\nAweakness ofthecurrentstudywasthatit wasnotsufﬁcient-ly powered to identify differences in incidence of postoperative respiratory complications. The incidence of severe respiratory complications is generally low after surgery; an example is post-operative respiratory failure requiring re-intubation, which was recently found to be 0.41%.31 Conservatively assuming an inci-dence of 6% in the neostigmine group vs 3% in the sugammadex group, it is estimated that, for a power of 80% to statistically de-tect a difference in postoperative respiratory complications be-tween patients administered sugammadex vs usual care, a total of ≥1600 subjects would be required.\nOur study design might have contributed to our ﬁnding a lower incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade in the sugammadex group compared with the neostigmine group. In fact, anaesthesia providers were given directions on how to use sugammadex, whereas neostigmine dosing was kept at the dis-cretion of the anaesthesiologist. In one third of patients in the neostigmine group, the reversal agent was administered in an unwarranted fashion,16 deﬁned as administration either in the absence of a documented TOF-count, or at a documented deep\n16\nneuromuscularblockade(TOF-count0or1). This inadequate use of neostigmine may translate to postoperative respiratory failure.16 Other data suggest that it is possible that anaesthesia providersusesugammadexinanunwarrantedfashion(e.g.with-out TOF-monitoring, or by using an inadequate dose). It was re-ported in an effectiveness study that residual neuromuscular blockade occurred in about 5% of patients after sugammadex ad-ministration without TOF-monitoring.32 Of note, recurarisation or incomplete reversal after sugammadex, can only occur when the number of circulating sugammadex molecules is not sufﬁ-cient to bind to a critical number of rocuronium molecules, pre-sentinthebody.Onemoleculeofsugammadexencapsulates one molecule of rocuronium: for instance, 200 mg of sugamma-dex i.v. binds to 55 mg of rocuronium i.v. When a large dose of rocuronium is given followed by an inadequate dose of sugam-madex, it is possible that previously redistributed rocuronium mightbemobilized,toproducedelayedneuromuscularblockade, as has been previously described by Plaud and co-workers.33 Accordingly, the absence of evidence of residual blockade after sugammadex, as shown in our study, does not implicate evi-dence of absence of any risk of residual paralysis when sugam-madex is given. Quantitative neuromuscular transmission monitoring is the only way to exclude residual neuromuscular blockade at the end of the procedure.\n \n750 | Brueckmann et al.\n \nWe performed TOF-measurements in awake patients. We cannot exclude the possibility that these measurements were in-ﬂuenced by either voluntary or non-voluntary movements of the patienttowhich thethumbmaybesubject.34\nTOF-ratiomeasure-ments in awake patients have been assessed in several prior studies.635\nFurthermore, in our clinical practice, clinical deci-sions of diagnosis of residual neuromuscular blockade in the PACU are made based on TOF-ratio measurements in awake pa-tients.Tominimizetheriskforpotential biasthepatient andTOF assessor were blinded to the study drug.\nIn the present study, the time between reversal agent admin-istration and operating room discharge-readiness wasshorterfor sugammadex vs usual care, indicating accelerated neuromuscu-lar function recovery in the operating room and increased surgi-cal efﬁciency. Rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade may be cost-effective, if rapid recovery of muscle strength can be translated into a reduction of recovery time in routine clinical practice,24\nalthough further studies are needed.\nIn summary, in this trial reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex eliminated residual neuromuscular blockade and associated clinically meaningful symptoms of partial paralysis.\nAuthors’ contributions\nB.B. and N.S. contributed to data acquisition and writing of the manuscript.P.G.,M.K.L.and A.K.S-R.contributedtothestatistical analysisandwriting of manuscript.

Deep neuromuscular blockade \n(NMB) may not always be maintained to the \nend of surgery and the depth of block may \nbe allowed to gradually diminish over time, \nparticularly if reversal of NMB is not routine-\nly performed.\nAim. The current study aimed to assess re-\ncovery from deep rocuronium-induced NMB \nwith sugammadex compared with place-\nbo, provide data regarding the extent of re-\nsidual blockade after deep rocuronium-in-\nduced NMB (placebo group), and to deter-\nmine whether complete and reliable recovery \ncould be provided by sugammadex (sugam-\nmadex group).\nMaterials and methods. This was a random-\nized, placebo-controlled, safety-assessor-\nblinded study in adult patients of American \nSociety of Anesthesiologists Class I to III. Pa-\ntients with clinically relevant kidney or liver \ninsufficiency were excluded. Anesthesia was \nadministered as routinely practiced at each \nstudy site. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was ad-\n\nministered for intubation, with maintenance \ndoses of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg as needed. After the \nlast rocuronium dose, at deep NMB (target \ndepth 1–2 post-tetanic counts), patients re-\nceived a single dose of sugammadex 4.0 mg/\nkg or placebo as randomized. The primary \nendpoint was time from sugammadex or pla-\ncebo administration to recovery of the train-\nof-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. Safety was assessed \nthrough monitoring of adverse events, vi-\ntal signs and physical examination. Patients \nwere also assessed for evidence of residu-\nal or recurrence of NMB. With this design, the \nstudy will provide data regarding the extent \nof residual blockade under these conditions \n(placebo group), and determine whether \ncomplete and reliable recovery could be pro-\nvided by sugammadex (sugammadex group).\nResults. Recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 with \nsugammadex was significantly faster (~ 40 \ntimes) than spontaneous recovery: geometric \nmean (95 % confidence interval) times were \n2.2 (1.9–2.5) and 89.8 (80.1–100.7) min, re-\n\nspectively (p < 0.0001, N = 134); maximum \nspontaneous recovery was 289.8 min. Safety \nwas comparable between groups, with no re-\ncurrence of blockade.\nConclusions. This study confirms a pro-\nlonged residual blockade in patients who did \nnot receive sugammadex, with median time \nto recovery > 1.5 h in the placebo group and \none patient taking 4.8 h to achieve a safe lev-\nel of neuromuscular function recovery fol-\nlowing deep NMB. In contrast, sugammadex \nprovided complete and reliable recovery of \nneuromuscular function (median time to re-\ncovery of 2.0 min).

However, administra-\ntion of numerous maintenance doses may \nresult in an accumulation of the muscle \nrelaxant and repeated use of intermediate-\nacting NMBAs has been associated with \nresidual blockade in the recovery room \n[1], which is a risk factor for postoperative \npulmonary complications [2, 3]. Further-\nmore, the majority of reversal agents are \nineffective at deeper levels of NMB [4, 5] \nand in any case, many anesthetic practitio-\nners do not routinely use reversal agents \ndue to other concerns [6]. Consequently, \nmaintaining a deep rocuronium-induced \nNMB until the end of the operation is fre-\nquently avoided in clinical practice and \nhas not been widely researched.\nThe selective relaxant binding agent \nsugammadex has been shown to re-\nverse the effects of moderate and deep \nrocuronium- and vecuronium-induced \nNMB completely and rapidly, in a predict-able manner, even under the condition of a high serum level of rocuronium [4, 7– 9]. The current study assessed the efficacy and safety of spontaneous recovery from prolonged rocuronium-induced NMB compared with recovery with sugamma-dex 4.0 mg/kg administered at deep NMB, defined as a target depth of 1–2 post-tetan-ic counts (PTC).\nThe study also aimed to fully assess the extent of the period of diminishing, but still clinically relevant, residual NMB fol-lowing prolonged exposure to rocuroni-um by assessing neuromuscular recov-ery in patients receiving placebo follow-ing from deep NMB (i.e., spontaneous re-covery).\nMethods\nThis randomized, parallel-group, place-bo-controlled, safety-assessor-blinded, phase IIIb study (Sunlight study; clinical-trials.gov [NCT00758485]; sponsor proto-col number P05767), was conducted at 10 sites in Germany (. Infobox 1). The study \nwas conducted in accordance with princi-ples of Good Clinical Practice and was ap-proved by the appropriate institutional re-view boards and regulatory agencies. All patients provided written informed con-sent before enrollment.\nPatients\nPatients were included if they were aged ≥ 18 years, American Society of Anesthesi-ologists Class I to III, and scheduled to un-dergo a surgical procedure under general anesthesia using deep NMB. Patients were excluded if they had significant hepatic or renal dysfunction; were expected to have a difficult intubation or be transferred to in-tensive care after surgery; had neuromus-cular disorders affecting NMB; an allergy to opioids, cyclodextrins, muscle relaxants or other medications used during general anesthesia; or had previously participated in a sugammadex study or other interven-tional study within 30 days prior to enroll-ment.

Patients received an-esthesia as routinely practiced at each of the investigational study sites. Neuromus-cular monitoring was performed continu-ously at the adductor pollicis muscle with acceleromyography (TOF-Watch® SX, Or-ganon Ireland Ltd., a subsidiary of Mer-ck and Co., Swords, Co. Dublin, Ireland). The study sponsor provided neuromus-cular transmission monitoring guidelines on the use and interpretation of the TOF-Watch® SX to reduce variability between sites; this guidance followed the basic principles of good clinical research prac-tice (GCRP) in pharmacodynamic studies of neuromuscular blocking agents [10]. All members of the trial team were assessed prior to the start of the trial to obtain ap-proval for operating the TOF-Watch® SX and evaluating trace data. The monitored \narm of the patient was immobilized. Fol-lowing the induction of anesthesia, the TOF-Watch® SX responses were stabilized and the device calibrated. Repetitive train-of-four (TOF) stimulation was applied by the TOF-Watch® SX every 15 s at the ulnar nerve until at least TOF ratio of 0.9. Af-ter calibration of the TOF-Watch® SX, ro-curonium 0.6 mg/kg was administered as an intravenous bolus dose for intubation, with maintenance doses of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg given as necessary according to the local routine anesthetic practice at each inves-tigational site to maintain deep NMB (1–2 PTC). At the end of the operation, at a tar-get depth of 1–2 PTC after the last dose of rocuronium, patients received a single in-travenous dose of sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg or placebo, according to randomization. Efficacy endpoints\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the time from the start of sugammadex or placebo administration to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9.\nOther assessments\nOther pre-defined analyses included time from operating room (OR) admission to the patient being considered ready for dis-charge from the OR (TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 and wound dressing in place), time from study drug administration to the patient being considered ready for discharge from the OR, and time from admission to the post-anesthetic recovery unit (PACU) to the patient being considered ready for dis-charge from the PACU (defined by a mod-ified Aldrete Score ≥ 9) [11].\nSafety assessments\nSafety was assessed by a blinded safety as-sessor (who was not involved in random-ization of the patient, preparation or ad-ministration of study medication or an-esthesia after administration of the study drug), and included monitoring of AEs, vital signs and physical examination. Pa-tients were also assessed for evidence of recurrence of NMB after initial recovery, based on a decline in the TOF ratio from ≥ 0.9 to < 0.8 in at least three consecutive TOF values, as well as clinical evidence of residual NMB or recurrence of NMB (as-\nsessed according to routine practice, for \nexample by monitoring oxygen satura-\ntion and respiratory rate).\nStatistical analysis\nThe sample size was determined to pro-\nvide sufficient power to address both the \nprimary analysis (time from the start of \nsugammadex or placebo administration \nto recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9) based \non previous studies [4, 8], and the second-\nary analyses related to lengths of stay in \nthe OR and PACU. Since no previous da-\nta on the length of stay in the OR and PA-\nCU were available, it was estimated that \na difference of half a standard deviation \nshould be detected with 80 % probabil-\nity. Assuming a drop-out rate of 8 %, 70 \npatients per group were to be enrolled, \nwhich also provided sufficient power for \nthe primary analysis.\nThe intent-to-treat (ITT) group in-\ncluded randomized patients who received \nthe randomized treatment and had at least \none efficacy measurement. The all-sub-\njects-treated (AST) group consisted of all \npatients who received a dose of the study \ndrug.\nThe primary efficacy analyses were \nperformed for the ITT group using im-\nputed data for missing values with a con-\nservative approach toward sugammadex. \nSafety analyses were performed for the \nAST group. Demographic data, AEs and \nvital signs were summarized using de-\nscriptive statistics.\nTimes from administration of the \nstudy drug to recovery of the TOF ratio \n0.9 were compared between the two treat-\nment groups by an analysis of variance \n(ANOVA) adjusted for trial site. The re-\nsponse variable of the ANOVA model was \nthe logarithm of the recovery time, since \nrecovery times are known to follow an ap-\nproximately lognormal distribution [12]. \nConsequently, recovery times were sum-\nmarized using geometric means and as-\nsociated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). \nMedian, interquartile range (IQR) and \nrange values were also reported.\nData related to the stay in the OR and \nPACU, and the time from study drug ad-\nministration to the patient being con-\nsidered ready for discharge from the \nOR, were all compared between the two \n \n| 507\nDer Anaesthesist 7 • 2015 \n \nAbstract • Zusammenfassung\n \nAnaesthesist 2015 • 64:506–512 DOI 10.1007/s00101-015-0048-0\n© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015\n \nN.

However, the variation of the recovery time in the placebo group (50 times higher than in the sugammadex group with some extremely long peak val-ues) was somewhat less predictable. May-bauer and colleagues previously reported a mean (SD) recovery time of 63 (29) min following administration of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg with spontaneous recovery, although the depth of NMB was main-tained at a shallower level than the current study (maintenance doses of rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg were given upon recovery of the twitch height [T1/T0] to 0.2) [15]. In the current study, the median (IQR) time to complete recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was 95.8 (58.2–123.3) min in the place-bo group, with a maximum recovery time of 289.8 min observed. The exclusion cri-teria of clinically relevant kidney and liver insufficiency should limit the reasons for substantially prolonged recovery times, but only served to illustrate that risk as-sessment of patients can be unreliable.\nClinical evidence of residual block-ade was not reported in the current study; this is because patients’ tracheas were ex-tubated only once a TOF ratio of 0.9 was reached. However, one patient in the pla-cebo group experienced an AE of severe “neuromuscular block prolonged”. Impor-tantly, there was no evidence of recurrence of NMB in patients in the study despite the prolonged exposure to rocuronium and the possibility of accumulation of the NMBA, indicating that the rapid recovery following administration of sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg is sustained. Postoperative re-sidual blockade is potentially a serious pa-tient safety issue [5, 16], with a recent study suggesting that incomplete recovery from NMB is an important contributing factor to adverse respiratory events in the PACU [3]. The rapid recovery and lack of post-operative residual blockade following su-gammadex administration in the current study suggests that sugammadex may al-low the anesthetist to maintain deep block-ade for as long as is required, even up until the end of surgery; although no patients in the placebo group experienced recurrence of NMB following spontaneous recovery from deep NMB to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9, the slow and variable nature of the recov-\nery means that such an approach would be unfeasible in everyday practice.\nThe longer recovery times observed for patients receiving placebo compared with those in the sugammadex group has potential implications for operating room efficiency. In a recent retrospective inves-tigation of postoperative outcome after reversal of NMB with either sugamma-dex, neostigmine or no reversal, time of surgery was significantly shorter in pa-tients reversed with sugammadex com-pared with those who did not [17]. How-ever, similar to the current study which determined no significant difference in the duration of stay in the PACU for pa-tients receiving sugammadex versus pla-cebo, no significant differences in either length of PACU stay or hospital stay were determined between patients who re-ceived sugammadex and those who re-ceived either neostigmine or no rever-sal. There were other notable benefits ob-served in the sugammadex group, such as a lower rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the PACU in su-gammadex-treated patients compared with neostigmine [17]. Additional stud-ies are required to confirm whether any of the potential benefits described in the current study and the retrospective anal-ysis of Ledowski and colleagues will trans-late into everyday clinical practice.\nA limitation of the current study is that it was not powered to detect clinically rel-evant differences between the groups with regards to safety data. Nevertheless, this is one of the largest studies to date investi-gating sugammadex reversal of deep ro-curonium-induced NMB, and adds to the database of safety information for sugam-madex. The study protocol did not pre-specify the anesthetic techniques used, or the number of maintenance rocuronium doses administered. Nevertheless, the re-sults are generally applicable to patients undergoing surgery requiring prolonged, deep NMB, and confirm that sugamma-dex provides consistently rapid recovery from deep NMB.\nConclusions\nThis study presents data concerning the duration of postoperative NMB follow-ing deep NMB until the end of the surgical \nprocedure. Spontaneous recovery from \ndeep rocuronium-induced NMB is slow \n(median 96 min), and due to a large inter-\nindividual variability (range: 38–290 min; \ninterquartile range: 58.2–123.3 min), hard \nto predict. In contrast, reversal of this NMB \nby sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg provided a \nfast (median 2 min), predictable (range: \n0.9–20.4 min; interquartile range: 1.6–\n2.8 min), and reliable recovery (without \nrecurrence of NMB).\nCorresponding address\nProf. N.

The current study assessed the efficacy and safety of spontaneous recovery from prolonged rocuronium-induced NMB compared with recovery with sugamma-dex 4.0 mg/kg administered at deep NMB, defined as a target depth of 1–2 post-tetan-ic counts (PTC).\nThe study also aimed to fully assess the extent of the period of diminishing, but still clinically relevant, residual NMB fol-lowing prolonged exposure to rocuroni-um by assessing neuromuscular recov-ery in patients receiving placebo follow-ing from deep NMB (i.e., spontaneous re-covery).\nMethods\nThis randomized, parallel-group, place-bo-controlled, safety-assessor-blinded, phase IIIb study (Sunlight study; clinical-trials.gov [NCT00758485]; sponsor proto-col number P05767), was conducted at 10 sites in Germany (.

Patients received an-esthesia as routinely practiced at each of the investigational study sites. Neuromus-cular monitoring was performed continu-ously at the adductor pollicis muscle with acceleromyography (TOF-Watch® SX, Or-ganon Ireland Ltd., a subsidiary of Mer-ck and Co., Swords, Co. Dublin, Ireland). The study sponsor provided neuromus-cular transmission monitoring guidelines on the use and interpretation of the TOF-Watch® SX to reduce variability between sites; this guidance followed the basic principles of good clinical research prac-tice (GCRP) in pharmacodynamic studies of neuromuscular blocking agents [10]. All members of the trial team were assessed prior to the start of the trial to obtain ap-proval for operating the TOF-Watch® SX and evaluating trace data. The monitored \narm of the patient was immobilized. Fol-lowing the induction of anesthesia, the TOF-Watch® SX responses were stabilized and the device calibrated. Repetitive train-of-four (TOF) stimulation was applied by the TOF-Watch® SX every 15 s at the ulnar nerve until at least TOF ratio of 0.9. Af-ter calibration of the TOF-Watch® SX, ro-curonium 0.6 mg/kg was administered as an intravenous bolus dose for intubation, with maintenance doses of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg given as necessary according to the local routine anesthetic practice at each inves-tigational site to maintain deep NMB (1–2 PTC). At the end of the operation, at a tar-get depth of 1–2 PTC after the last dose of rocuronium, patients received a single in-travenous dose of sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg or placebo, according to randomization. Efficacy endpoints\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the time from the start of sugammadex or placebo administration to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9.\nOther assessments\nOther pre-defined analyses included time from operating room (OR) admission to the patient being considered ready for dis-charge from the OR (TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 and wound dressing in place), time from study drug administration to the patient being considered ready for discharge from the OR, and time from admission to the post-anesthetic recovery unit (PACU) to the patient being considered ready for dis-charge from the PACU (defined by a mod-ified Aldrete Score ≥ 9) [11].\nSafety assessments\nSafety was assessed by a blinded safety as-sessor (who was not involved in random-ization of the patient, preparation or ad-ministration of study medication or an-esthesia after administration of the study drug), and included monitoring of AEs, vital signs and physical examination. Pa-tients were also assessed for evidence of recurrence of NMB after initial recovery, based on a decline in the TOF ratio from ≥ 0.9 to < 0.8 in at least three consecutive TOF values, as well as clinical evidence of residual NMB or recurrence of NMB (as-\nsessed according to routine practice, for \nexample by monitoring oxygen satura-\ntion and respiratory rate).\nStatistical analysis\nThe sample size was determined to pro-\nvide sufficient power to address both the \nprimary analysis (time from the start of \nsugammadex or placebo administration \nto recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9) based \non previous studies [4, 8], and the second-\nary analyses related to lengths of stay in \nthe OR and PACU. Since no previous da-\nta on the length of stay in the OR and PA-\nCU were available, it was estimated that \na difference of half a standard deviation \nshould be detected with 80 % probabil-\nity. Assuming a drop-out rate of 8 %, 70 \npatients per group were to be enrolled, \nwhich also provided sufficient power for \nthe primary analysis.\nThe intent-to-treat (ITT) group in-\ncluded randomized patients who received \nthe randomized treatment and had at least \none efficacy measurement. The all-sub-\njects-treated (AST) group consisted of all \npatients who received a dose of the study \ndrug.\nThe primary efficacy analyses were \nperformed for the ITT group using im-\nputed data for missing values with a con-\nservative approach toward sugammadex. \nSafety analyses were performed for the \nAST group.

The re-\nsponse variable of the ANOVA model was \nthe logarithm of the recovery time, since \nrecovery times are known to follow an ap-\nproximately lognormal distribution [12]. \nConsequently, recovery times were sum-\nmarized using geometric means and as-\nsociated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). \nMedian, interquartile range (IQR) and \nrange values were also reported.\nData related to the stay in the OR and \nPACU, and the time from study drug ad-\nministration to the patient being con-\nsidered ready for discharge from the \nOR, were all compared between the two \n \n| 507\nDer Anaesthesist 7 • 2015 \n \nAbstract • Zusammenfassung\n \nAnaesthesist 2015 • 64:506–512 DOI 10.1007/s00101-015-0048-0\n© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015\n \nN.

Deep neuromuscular blockade \n(NMB) may not always be maintained to the \nend of surgery and the depth of block may \nbe allowed to gradually diminish over time, \nparticularly if reversal of NMB is not routine-\nly performed.\nAim. The current study aimed to assess re-\ncovery from deep rocuronium-induced NMB \nwith sugammadex compared with place-\nbo, provide data regarding the extent of re-\nsidual blockade after deep rocuronium-in-\nduced NMB (placebo group), and to deter-\nmine whether complete and reliable recovery \ncould be provided by sugammadex (sugam-\nmadex group).\nMaterials and methods. This was a random-\nized, placebo-controlled, safety-assessor-\nblinded study in adult patients of American \nSociety of Anesthesiologists Class I to III. Pa-\ntients with clinically relevant kidney or liver \ninsufficiency were excluded. Anesthesia was \nadministered as routinely practiced at each \nstudy site. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was ad-\nministered for intubation, with maintenance doses of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg as needed. After the last rocuronium dose, at deep NMB (target depth 1–2 post-tetanic counts), patients re-ceived a single dose of sugammadex 4.0 mg/ kg or placebo as randomized. The primary endpoint was time from sugammadex or pla-cebo administration to recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9. Safety was assessed through monitoring of adverse events, vi-tal signs and physical examination. Patients were also assessed for evidence of residu-al or recurrence of NMB. With this design, the study will provide data regarding the extent of residual blockade under these conditions (placebo group), and determine whether complete and reliable recovery could be pro-vided by sugammadex (sugammadex group). Results. Recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 with sugammadex was significantly faster (~ 40 times) than spontaneous recovery: geometric mean (95 % confidence interval) times were 2.2 (1.9–2.5) and 89.8 (80.1–100.7) min, re-\nspectively (p < 0.0001, N = 134); maximum \nspontaneous recovery was 289.8 min. Safety \nwas comparable between groups, with no re-\ncurrence of blockade.\nConclusions. This study confirms a pro-\nlonged residual blockade in patients who did \nnot receive sugammadex, with median time \nto recovery > 1.5 h in the placebo group and \none patient taking 4.8 h to achieve a safe lev-\nel of neuromuscular function recovery fol-\nlowing deep NMB. In contrast, sugammadex \nprovided complete and reliable recovery of \nneuromuscular function (median time to re-\ncovery of 2.0 min). Thus, deep NMB with ro-\ncuronium until the end of the operation may \nbe possible in combination with sugamma-\ndex reversal.\nKeywords\nNeuromuscular blockade • Placebo • \nRocuronium • Sugammadex\n \nErholung von einer verlängerten, Rocurionium-induzierten, tiefen neuromuskulären Blockade. \nEin randomisierter Vergleich der Reversion durch Sugammadex mit spontaner Erholung\n \nZusammenfassung		\nZiel der Arbeit.

The num-\nber of maintenance doses of rocuronium \nreceived by patients in either group did \nnot significantly impact on the observed \nrecovery to a TOF ratio of 0.9.\nTwo sugammadex-treated patients had \nprolonged times to recovery of the TOF \nratio to 0.9. One 72-year old male with a \nhistory of atrial fibrillation and decreased \ncardiac output had a recovery time of \n7.5 min. The second patient, a 44-year \nold male, in whom inhaled desflurane \nwas used for the maintenance of anesthe-\nsia, and who had a high first twitch signal \nin relation to a second, third and fourth \ntwitch from baseline onwards, had a re-\ncovery time of 20 min.\nIn the placebo group, median time to \na TOF ratio of 0.9 varied across the three \nmost frequently performed surgical cate-\ngories (median [range (IQR)]: 116.7 [54.3–\n159.8 (95.8–140.3)] min, 89.4 [45.1–127.9 \n(73.3–111.0)] min and 53.6 [41.0–242.8 \n(48.5–95.9)] min in the urinary system, \neye and adjacent structures, and ear, nose \nand larynx categories, respectively). For \nthe sugammadex group, recovery times \nwere similar across the three categories \nand less variation was observed compared \nwith placebo (2.3 [0.9–4.7 (1.8–3.8)] min, \n2.1 [1.4–7.5 (1.7–2.7)] min and 1.7 [0.9–5.0 \n(1.4–4.6)] min), respectively.\nOther assessments\nUnsurprisingly, given the prolonged re-\ncovery times in the placebo group, place-\nbo patients had a significantly longer time \nfrom OR admission to being considered \nready for discharge from the OR com-\npared with patients in the sugammadex \ngroup (median durations of 217 min with \nplacebo versus 137 min with sugamma-\ndex; p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test \nstratified for study site) and took longer \nfrom study drug administration to the pa-\ntient being considered ready for discharge \nfrom the OR (median times of 103 min \nand 9 min for placebo and sugammad-\nex, respectively; p < 0.0001). However, the \nmedian time from PACU admission to the \npatient being considered ready for dis-\ncharge from the PACU was not statistical-\nly significantly different between the two \ntreatment groups (10 min in the placebo \ngroup, 9 min in the sugammadex group).\n \n| 509\nDer Anaesthesist 7 • 2015 \n \nOriginalien\n \nTable 1	Summary of patient baseline characteristics (AST group; N = 137)	Safety analyses\n \n\n \nSugammadex 4.0 mg/kg (N = 69) Placebo (N = 68)	\nGender, N (%)	In the AST group, 59 (86.8 %) placebo \nMale 48 (70) 43 (63)	patients and 53 (76.8 %) sugammadex \n	patients had at least one AE (.

However, the variation of the recovery time in the placebo group (50 times higher than in the sugammadex group with some extremely long peak val-ues) was somewhat less predictable. May-bauer and colleagues previously reported a mean (SD) recovery time of 63 (29) min following administration of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg with spontaneous recovery, although the depth of NMB was main-tained at a shallower level than the current study (maintenance doses of rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg were given upon recovery of the twitch height [T1/T0] to 0.2) [15]. In the current study, the median (IQR) time to complete recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was 95.8 (58.2–123.3) min in the place-bo group, with a maximum recovery time of 289.8 min observed. The exclusion cri-teria of clinically relevant kidney and liver insufficiency should limit the reasons for substantially prolonged recovery times, but only served to illustrate that risk as-sessment of patients can be unreliable.\nClinical evidence of residual block-ade was not reported in the current study; this is because patients’ tracheas were ex-tubated only once a TOF ratio of 0.9 was reached. However, one patient in the pla-cebo group experienced an AE of severe “neuromuscular block prolonged”. Impor-tantly, there was no evidence of recurrence of NMB in patients in the study despite the prolonged exposure to rocuronium and the possibility of accumulation of the NMBA, indicating that the rapid recovery following administration of sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg is sustained. Postoperative re-sidual blockade is potentially a serious pa-tient safety issue [5, 16], with a recent study suggesting that incomplete recovery from NMB is an important contributing factor to adverse respiratory events in the PACU [3]. The rapid recovery and lack of post-operative residual blockade following su-gammadex administration in the current study suggests that sugammadex may al-low the anesthetist to maintain deep block-ade for as long as is required, even up until the end of surgery; although no patients in the placebo group experienced recurrence of NMB following spontaneous recovery from deep NMB to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9, the slow and variable nature of the recov-\nery means that such an approach would be unfeasible in everyday practice.\nThe longer recovery times observed for patients receiving placebo compared with those in the sugammadex group has potential implications for operating room efficiency. In a recent retrospective inves-tigation of postoperative outcome after reversal of NMB with either sugamma-dex, neostigmine or no reversal, time of surgery was significantly shorter in pa-tients reversed with sugammadex com-pared with those who did not [17]. How-ever, similar to the current study which determined no significant difference in the duration of stay in the PACU for pa-tients receiving sugammadex versus pla-cebo, no significant differences in either length of PACU stay or hospital stay were determined between patients who re-ceived sugammadex and those who re-ceived either neostigmine or no rever-sal. There were other notable benefits ob-served in the sugammadex group, such as a lower rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the PACU in su-gammadex-treated patients compared with neostigmine [17]. Additional stud-ies are required to confirm whether any of the potential benefits described in the current study and the retrospective anal-ysis of Ledowski and colleagues will trans-late into everyday clinical practice.\nA limitation of the current study is that it was not powered to detect clinically rel-evant differences between the groups with regards to safety data. Nevertheless, this is one of the largest studies to date investi-gating sugammadex reversal of deep ro-curonium-induced NMB, and adds to the database of safety information for sugam-madex. The study protocol did not pre-specify the anesthetic techniques used, or the number of maintenance rocuronium doses administered. Nevertheless, the re-sults are generally applicable to patients undergoing surgery requiring prolonged, deep NMB, and confirm that sugamma-dex provides consistently rapid recovery from deep NMB.\nConclusions\nThis study presents data concerning the duration of postoperative NMB follow-ing deep NMB until the end of the surgical \nprocedure. Spontaneous recovery from \ndeep rocuronium-induced NMB is slow \n(median 96 min), and due to a large inter-\nindividual variability (range: 38–290 min; \ninterquartile range: 58.2–123.3 min), hard \nto predict. In contrast, reversal of this NMB \nby sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg provided a \nfast (median 2 min), predictable (range: \n0.9–20.4 min; interquartile range: 1.6–\n2.8 min), and reliable recovery (without \nrecurrence of NMB).\nCorresponding address\nProf. N.

The investigation is retro-\nspective, and the rate of PONV was low. The conclusions must therefore be interpreted\ncautiously.\n \nPost-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a As a result, PONV lengthens hospital stays and common complication that causes discomfort, increases medical cost.2 The incidence of PONV pain, and surgical site instability, including has been reported to be 30% in general patients, wound dehiscence and bleeding.1 Furthermore, and as high as 80% in high-risk patients.3,4 PONV increases the risk of aspiration, the inci- Opioid-based, intravenous, patient-controlled dence of electrolyte imbalance, and dehydration. analgesia (IV-PCA) aggravates PONV; however,\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45	\nª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

LEE ET AL.\n \nsuch treatment is necessary for patients who have undergone surgery.5\nThere are several types of receptor for emetogenic neurotransmitters: dopamine (D )\n2 receptors, histaminic (H ) receptors, 5-hydroxy-\n1\ntryptamine (serotonin) receptors, and mus-\n3\ncarinic-cholinergic receptors.6 On this theoretical basis, cholinesterase inhibitors (neostigmine in particular), which are used to reverse non-depo-larizing neuromuscular blocking agents, have been associated with increased PONV.7–10\nPyridostigmine, which is also classiﬁed as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is structurally similar to neostigmine. No association has yet been revealed between pyridostigmine and PONV. However, pyridostigmine overdose does cause cholinergic symptoms, including nausea and\n11;\nvomiting for this reason, it is theoretically possible that pyridostigmine causes PONV.\nSugammadex is a new gamma-cyclodextrin drug that binds to aminosteroidal non-depolar-izing neuromuscular blocking agents.12 It is a fast-onset drug that resolves residual paralysis without the muscarinic side effects that occur with traditional anticholinergic-cholinesterase inhibitor mixtures13 Furthermore, sugammadex has been associated with a lower rate of PONV than neostigmine.14,15\nNonetheless, no studies have been carried out comparing the rates of PONV between sugammadex and pyridostig-mine.\nFor this reason, we designed a retrospective study to compare the incidence and severity of PONV between sugammadex and pyridostig-mine–glycopyrrolate mixture.\nMethods\nStudy design\nAfter obtaining approval of Institutional Review Board of Chung-Ang University Hospital [IRB No. C2015250(1708)], we reviewed the elec-tronic medical records of 7179 adults who had undergone general anesthesia at Chung-Ang University Hospital between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. All the patients had been treated using fentanyl-based IV-PCA. We anonymized and de-identiﬁed all information prior to analysis, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The reversal\nagents were injected immediately after the end of the surgery; patients were excluded from the study if no reversal agents were used. We classi-ﬁed patients into two groups on the basis of the reversal agent used: pyridostigmine–glycopyrro-late mixture (Group R) and sugammadex (Group S). The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemi-ology) checklist was used to construct this manuscript.16\nPCA protocol\nIn our institution, we used the existing stan-dardized IV-PCA protocol of the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine: standard-ized to continuous infusion of 1 ml/h, as well as a bolus of 1 ml with a 15-min lockout interval. The 100-ml IV-PCA solution contained fentanyl, ketorolac or nefopam, and ramosetron or palo-nosetron. The correct dosage of fentanyl, ketoro-lac, or nefopam was established according to the Department of Surgery concerned, and the expected intensity of pain (mild, moderate, or severe) after each type of surgery.\nData collection\nUsing the data recorded by a nurse dedicated to the management of patients with IV-PCA, we noted demographic and perioperative factors that are related to PONV. The nurse only under-took tasks related to IV-PCA, and she made the rounds at least once a day to investigate issues related to IV-PCA, including PONV. She had 5 years’ clinical experience, and she collected data after being trained in the standardized pro-tocols of pain and PONV investigation. Further-more, we excluded the data collected during the ﬁrst 2 years of her PCA rounds (2008–2009). Speciﬁcally, we collected data on age, gender, height, weight, history of smoking, PONV, type of anesthetic agents used (propofol, desﬂurane, or sevoﬂurane), use of N O, remifentanil, use of\n2\nanticholinergics (glycopyrrolate) as premedica-tion, use of nefopam, ketorolac, ramosetron, or palonosetron in IV-PCA, dosage of fentanyl in IV-PCA, laparoscopic surgery, and operation duration. Furthermore, the post-operative vari-ables collected were severity of nausea, fre-quency of vomiting, use of rescue antiemetics,\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45 40 ª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

These variables were measured on post-operative days 0; CR was deﬁned as no nausea, no vomiting, and no requirement for antiemetics during post-opera-tive days 0.\nSeverity of nausea was recorded using a numeric rating scale (0 = no nausea, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = worst imaginable). Statistics\nWe matched patients from Group R at a 4 to 1 ratio with those from Group S using a propen-sity score matching method. Because this was a retrospective cohort study, not a randomized clinical trial, potential confounding factors were caused by biased covariates and non-randomiza-tion; thus, comparability between Groups R and S was problematic.17,18 For this reason, we con-ducted propensity score matching – to decrease the potential confounding. We calculated the propensity score using logistic regression analy-sis; the following covariates were used: age, gender, height, weight, history of smoking, PONV, type of anesthetic agents used (propofol, desﬂurane, or sevoﬂurane), use of N Oor\n2\nremifentanil, use of anticholinergics (glycopy-rrolate) as premedication, use of nefopam, ketorolac, ramosetron, or palonosetron in IV-PCA, dosage of fentanyl in IV-PCA, laparo-scopic surgery, and operation duration.19 After the propensity scores were calculated, we used propensity score similarities to select the near-est-available match between the groups; the caliper radius was set at 0.001. To evaluate the balance between the matched groups, we tested the standardized difference for each of the covariates mentioned above. Speciﬁcally, the standardized difference is the difference in means between the groups – in units of stan-dard deviation. Comparability between the groups is usually considered to be good when the standardized difference is less than 20%.20\nAfter matching, we collected and compared the dosage of reversal agents, as well as the Department of Surgery concerned, usage of neu-romuscular monitoring and intraoperative opi-oids in each of the matched groups.\nFor continuous variables, the data distribution was ﬁrst evaluated for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data\nwere then compared using parametric methods; non-normally distributed data were analyzed using non-parametric methods.\nPaired t-test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare continuous variables, and McNemar test was used to compare descriptive variables.\nContinuous variables were expressed as mean   SD, and descriptive variables were expressed as absolute number (%). The 95% conﬁdence intervals (C.I.) for difference were also calculated.\nP-values < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software suite (version 23; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\nResults\nWe reviewed 7179 adult patients who had undergone general anesthesia and treated using fentanyl-based IV-PCA at Chung-Ang Univer-sity Hospital between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. Group R contained 7059 patients, while Group S contained 120 patients.\nGroup R vs. Group S in the matched set The demographic and clinical characteristics of the matched cohort are shown in Table 1. After propensity score matching, there were 408 patients in Group R and 115 in Group S. All 20 confounding variables had an acceptable stan-dardized difference (i.e., < 20%), indicating that the matching procedure was efﬁcient in creating a balance between the groups (Table 1). The fol-lowing variables showed signiﬁcant differences between Group R and Group S: the nausea numeric rating scale score was lower in Group S than in Group R [0.33   0.74 vs. 0.17   0.42, respectively; difference (95% C.I.) = 0.17 (0.03– 0.31), P = 0.002]; the frequency of vomiting was lower in Group S than in Group R [0.10   0.32 vs. 0.04   0.21, respectively; difference (95% C.I.) = 0.06 (0.01–0.11), P = 0.036]; use of rescue antiemetics was lower in Group S than in Group R [160 (39.2%) vs. 33 (28.7%), respec-tively; difference (95% C.I.) = 0.11 (0.01–0.21), P = 0.039]; CR was higher in Group S than in Group R [221 (54.2%) vs. 77 (67%),\n \n\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45	\nª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

There was no signiﬁcant difference between the groups in terms of the Department of Surgery concerned, usage of neuromuscular monitoring and intraoperative opioids (P = 0.760, P = 0.577, P = 0.964, respectively; Table 3).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, the frequency of post-opera-tive vomiting and the severity of post-operative nausea were lower when the neuromuscular block was reversed using sugammadex than when it was reversed using the pyridostigmine– glycopyrrolate mixture. Furthermore, the frequency of CR was higher when sugammadex was used.\nThese ﬁndings corroborate those of previous studies. For instance, in a retrospective study by Ledowski et al., reversal of neuromuscular blockade using sugammadex caused less PONV than reversal using neostigmine.15 Similarly, in a randomized clinical trial by Koyuncu et al., reversal using sugammadex resulted in lower PONV than reversal using neostigmine–atropine mixture.14\nOn the other hand, our results differ from those of Abad-Gurumeta et al. In a meta-analy-sis, they reported that the frequency of PONV does not differ signiﬁcantly between neostig-\n21\nmine and sugammadex. However, they also found that their analysis had insufﬁcient power due to limited data.\nTraditional strategies for reversal of neuromus-cular blockade use a mixture of anticholinergics and cholinesterase inhibitors. Although they con-veniently reverse neuromuscular blockade, they are associated with cholinergic side effects such\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45 42 ª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Indeed, acetylcholine receptors are known for being distributed in the emetogenic center of brain, as well as in the gas-trointestinal tract.8 Therefore, cholinesterase inhibitors could in theory decrease esophageal sphincter pressure, and increase the secretion of stomach ﬂuid and intestinal movement. These mechanisms may be responsible for cholinester-ase inhibitor-associated PONV, and may explain the lower PONV associated with sugammadex in\nthe present study. In particular, relative over-doses of pyridostigmine compared to anticholin-ergics may also cause PONV. However, in the present study, the administered doses of glycopy-rrolate and pyridostigmine were 0.54   0.10 mg and 14.77   2.16 mg, respectively. Indeed, these are the usual doses and ratios of these reversal agents.22 Thus, we assumed that pyridostigmine overdose was not the cause of PONV in the pre-sent study.\nSeveral clinical studies and reviews have been conducted regarding the relationship between PONV and neostigmine; these have yielded uncertain and conﬂicting conclusions. For instance, in a meta-analysis by Cheng et al., neostigmine did not signiﬁcantly increase PONV during the post-operative period; the authors suggested that the data were insufﬁcient to con-\n23 Speciﬁ-clude that neostigmine causes PONV.\ncally, they stated that the lack of a signiﬁcant result was due to the limited numbers of control groups and patients. In any case, the Cheng study did not consider sugammadex for compar-ison. This limitation could be resolved in a future study that involving a control group in which sugammadex was used. With such a study, the association between PONV and choli-nesterase inhibitors would also be clearer.\nFurthermore, to our knowledge, the present arti-cle is the ﬁrst to report a relationship between pyri-dostigmine and PONV. There have been no randomized controlled trials comparing pyridostig-mine and sugammadex in terms of their effect on PONV; such trials may therefore be needed.\nReducing controllable risk factors can signiﬁ-cantly decrease the rate of PONV. However, most clinicians do not consider the risk of PONV when selecting reversal agents, because the conclusions of previous studies have been uncertain, and\n \n\n \nActa Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 61 (2017) 39–45	\nª 2016 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Nevertheless, we believe that we can reduce both residual paralysis and PONV with a single drug: sugammadex. However, owing to the high cost of sugammadex, a pharmacoeconomic analysis should also be conducted.\nRegarding post-operative pain after sugam-madex use, there may be some relationship between PONV and post-operative pain. In a randomized trial by Castro et al. involving patients who had undergone laparoscopic baria-tric surgery, reversal using sugammadex resulted in lower PONV and pain than reversal using neostigmine, and these results are similar to the present study.24 The authors conjectured that, because patients had lower levels of post-operative pain, they tended to use less opioid analgesics, and this in turn reduced the inci-dence of PONV. For this reason, it will be nec-essary to exclude the possibility that pain affects PONV before a conclusion can be drawn in this regard. For solving this point, we used the existing standardized IV-PCA protocol of our institution in the present study. As mentioned above, the IV-PCA drug dose of this protocol is determined according to the Department of Sur-gery and expected intensity of pain (mild, mod-erate, and severe) after each type of surgery. For this reason, the dose of fentanyl in the IV-PCA was matched between Groups R and S, and it is therefore likely that the surgical pain of each surgery was also matched. Furthermore, there were no differences between the groups with regard to the Department of Surgery.\nBecause this was a retrospective study, we tried to minimize bias and improve the quality of the study in various ways. Unlike a simple retro-spective chart review, the database was prospec-tively designed and recorded by one clinically experienced investigator who has long been responsible for IV-PCA; this minimized inter-observer variation, as well as subjectivity and other biases. Moreover, we excluded the early data, as it was likely to contain errors, incom-pleteness, and bias. Objective variables, such as the administration of rescue antiemetics, and CR, were collected to minimize the inﬂuence of sub-jective variables like PONV (Table 2). In addi-tion, we conducted propensity score matching to decrease the effects of known confounding fac-tors, and we compared both groups in terms of\nthe Department of Surgery, usage of neuromus-cular monitoring and intraoperative opioids to conﬁrm there were no signiﬁcant differences between the groups in this regard.\nThere were some limitations of this study. Firstly, because this was a retrospective study that collected data over a long period, some data were missing or incomplete. If these data had been investigated, the results would have been more conclusive. Secondly, the population of the pre-sent study was a very heterogeneous, and the risk of PONV was lower. For this reason, further inves-tigation is needed targeting the population with higher risk of PONV. Thirdly, because this was not a randomized controlled study, we cannot rule out confounding. Furthermore, although we used propensity score matching for known confounders, unknown risk factors may have inﬂuenced the results. Therefore, it may be necessary in future to carry out a randomized controlled trial comparing sugammadex and pyridostigmine–glycopyrrolate mixture. Fourthly, because this was a single-center study in Korea, our results may not be directly applicable to other countries and races. Finally, we did not divide the post-operative variables in this study into immediate PONV, early PONV, and late PONV; thus, we cannot determine whether the degree of PONV changed as time passed.\nIn conclusion, the severity and incidence of PONV in patients receiving opioid-based IV-PCA were lower in the sugammadex group than in the pyridostigmine–glycopyrrolate mixture group. However, these ﬁndings do not conﬁrm causality, because this was retrospective cohort study. Thus, further prospective randomized controlled studies should be needed to conﬁrm this conclusion.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank S-H Han for her effort to collect data.\nReferences\n1.

Introduction\nIn pediatric anesthesia, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA)arefrequentlyusedtofacilitatetrachealintubation [1],positivepressureventilation,andoptimalsurgicaloperat-ingconditions[2].Recently,somepublicationsinadults[ –6]\n3\nhave found that deep neuromuscular blockade signifcantly improves intra-abdominal space and surgical working con-ditions throughout laparoscopic procedures. However, the use of NMBA exposes the patient to the well-described risk of residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) [7]. In adults, many studies have estimated the risk of RNMB to range anywhere from 3.5% to 83% [8]. In children, however, the availabledataisextremelysparse[2]withjustonepublication investigating the matter within the last decade [9]. Te risks associated with RNMB are commonly underestimated by anesthesiologists, even though the pathophysiological\nconsequences of residual paralysis may be severe [8]. Te use of NMBA has been associated with an increased risk for respiratoryadverseeventsinchildrenundergoinganesthesia, particularly in the postoperative period [10], as well as with more direct impairments of lung function [11].\nIt was the aim of this prospective audit, therefore, to identify the rate and severity of RNMB at our tertiary pediatric center.\n2. Methods\nEthicsapprovalwasgrantedforthisprojectfromthePrincess Margaret Hospital Ethics Committee (457 QP) and recog-nized by the Human Research Ethics Ofce of the University of Western Australia (RA/4/1/5966). Written informed con-sent was waived since this audit was classifed as a quality of care audit due to its purely observational character.\n \n2 Anesthesiology Research and Practice\n \nAll children undergoing elective or urgent surgery under general anaesthesia requiring an endotracheal tube and receiving NMBA at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, Western Australia, during the time period from 11/9/2011 to 12/16/2011 were targeted forthisaudit. Exclusions included patients operated on outside normal working hours (Monday to Friday 8a.m. to 6p.m.), emergency procedures, children who were not planned to be extubated in the operating theatre, and infants under 12 months who were too small for the available monitoring electrodes to be attached.\nData recorded included basic demographic information, as well as preexisting medical conditions and preoperative medications,datarelatedtosurgeryandanesthesia(i.e., type of surgery, time of surgery and anesthesia, method of anesthesia,andNMBAused),andadverseeventsrecordedin thepostoperativeacutecareunit(PACU).\nAttheendofthesurgicalprocedureandwhentheattend-ing anesthesiologist deemed it safe to extubate the child, the train-of-four (TOF) ratio was assessed by an independent researcher using acceleromyometry (TOF Watch; Organon Teknika;Durham,NorthCarolina,USA)viaasupramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve. In the interests of patient safety, the results of this assessment were disclosed to the attending anesthesiologist immediately prior to extubation. However, the choice of whether or not to reverse the patient pharmacologically and when to extubate the patient was lef to the attending anesthesiologist.\nAfer tracheal extubation, children were transferred to the PACU, where adverse events (postoperative nausea and vomiting, severe pain, severe coughing, stridor/obstruction, broncho- or laryngospasm, and oxygen desaturation) were recorded by the attending nurses.\n2.1.SampleSizeandStatisticalAnalysis. Tesamplingperiod was not determined by a formal sample size calculation but simply by the desire to capture data over the equivalent of 1 calendar month [12].\nSubsequently, all data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 19 (IBM; Armonk, NY; USA). To compare the incidence of RNMB between diferent groups of patients, the Chi-square test was used. ANOVA was used to compare data between patients with or without TOF ratios of <0.9. � was set at 0.05. Data are displayed as mean (SD).\n3. Results\nDuring the 5-week study period, a total of 94 tracheally intubated children were screened for inclusion in this audit. Ofthose94children,30childrenwereexcludedasnoNMBA was subsequently given in these cases.\nData of 64 children (8.2 (5.9)yrs; 35.1 (22.6)kg) were analyzed.\nPatient characteristics and NMBA details are provided in Table 1.\nTe administration of an additional intraoperative dose of NMBA was given following a request for prolonged neuromuscular paralysis by the surgeon in all cases.\nNeuromuscular monitoring was not routinely used (total �=15(23.4%); TOF �=14 �=1such\n;PTC ),\nTable1:Patientcharacteristics(ASA:AmericanSocietyofAnesthe-siology, NMBA: neuromuscular blocking agent); total � =64.\nI: 34\nASA category (�) II: 20\nIII: 10\nGeneral: 24\nOrthopedic: 7\nUrology: 11\nProcedure (�) ENT: 5\nPlastics: 4\nEye: 2\nOther: 11\nElective: 44\nUrgency (�)\nUrgent: 20\nAtracurium: 41\nRocuronium: 15\nNMBA on induction (�)\nSuccinylcholine: 6\nVecuronium: 1\nAtracurium: 10\nRocuronium: 2 NMBA during maintenance (�)\nVecuronium: 1\nMivacurium: 1 that, in 49 children, the attending anesthesiologist used no neuromuscular monitoring at all.\nReversal was deemed to be required (by attending anes-thesiologist) in 33 (51.6%) children. In this instance, neostig-mine was given in 32 cases and sugammadex in 1 patient.\n−1\nNeostigminewasalwaysdosedas0.08mgkg andcombined with atropine 0.02mgkg−1.\nTe incidence of RNMB (TOFr < 0.9) was overall 28.1% (withoutreversal:19.4%;aferneostigmine:37.5%;� = 0.164).

However, at the time of independent TOF assessment immediately prior to tracheal extubation, 7/31 of those children had a TOF ratio <0.9 with 2 having a TOF ratio <0.7 (individual TOF ratios directly prior to extubation 34, 65, 75, 83, 85, 88, and 89, resp.).

Kapur1 described PONV as the ‘‘Big Little Problem’’ in 1991. While Watcha2 touched on Kapur’s deﬁnition, he summarized his own views of PONV as the ‘‘Big Big Prob-lem’’. PONV is one of most common complications after general anesthesia that may cause increased morbidity and prolonged hospital stay.3 Duration of anesthesia, type of surgery, postoperative analgesia with opioids, as well as patient related factors such as age, gender, smoking habits and previous history of PONV and of motion sickness are known as risk factors for developing PONV.3 --- 5\nNeuromuscular blocker medications are a necessary part of general anesthesia. Additionally at the end of the surgical procedure the majority of times the residual neuromuscu-lar block is reversed with acetyl choline esterase inhibitors.6 Cholinesterase inhibitors have been implicated in the devel-opment of PONV as a result of their potent muscarinic effects upon the gastrointestinal tract and the vomiting center in the brain.7 Neostigmine, used at the end of surgery for residual neuromuscular block, is associated with increased the risk of PONV, especially when used in large doses (>2.5 mg).7 Some previous studies have recommended avoiding the use of acetyl choline esterase inhibitors to reduce postoperative vomiting.8\nSugammadex is a   cyclodextrin agent that selectively binds steroidal neuromuscular blockers such as rocuronium. By making complexes with rocuronium in circulation and at\nneuromuscular junction, it enables the excretion of the drug in the urine without metabolization.9 Sugammadex gives rise to safe and rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium.10,11 Sugammadex is known as a safe drug without any known serious side effects. The common side effects of sugammadex are minimal cough, oral dis-comfort, hypersensitivity, temporary QT prolongation and temporary (<30 min) activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation.12 The studies on the effects of sugammadex on PONV are very limited.13\nThe hypothesis of our study is that use of sugammadex to antagonize the effects of neuromuscular blocker agents will reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting when compared with neostigmine. With the aim of testing this hypothesis we aimed to compare the effects of 2 mg kg−1 sugammadex and 50  g kg−1 neostigmine on the incidence of PONV. We deﬁned the major outcome as presence of PONV at the postoperative one hour period and number of patients who were needed ondansetron for symptomatic treatment during 24 hours postoperative period.\nMethod\nThis single-blind prospective randomized controlled study was conducted at ninety-six ASA I and II patients, aged in between 18 and 65 years, scheduled to have gen-eral anesthesia with endotracheal intubation for elective surgery. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of University School of Medicine (2014/515) and Clinical Trials study report (NCT) and conducted in accordance with the\n \nSugammadex and neostigmine on postoperative nausea and vomiting	149\n \n\n \nDeclaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in the study.\nExclusion criteria were including neurosurgery, laparo-scopic, oncologic, gynecologic, breast, strabismus and mid ear surgery, history of drug and alcohol abuse, body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg m−2, use of analgesics, sedative or antiemetic drugs within 24 hours before surgery, psychiatric and neurological disorders, allergy or contraindication of study drugs. Additionally patients with more than two hours surgery time were also excluded.\nNo preanaesthetic medication was administered. In the operating room, patients were monitored with ECG, non-invasive arterial pressure, peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2) and end-tidal CO2 levels (Mindray, BeneView T8, Shenzhen, PR China). An intravenous line of 10 mL kg−1 ringers lac-tate solution was infused via 20G venous cannula through the dorsum of the non dominant hand. Using a computer generated sequence of numbers and a sealed envelope technique, patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: patients who received neostigmine/atropine combination (Group N, n = 50) or sugammadex (Group S, n = 50) for rever-sal of neuromuscular blockade. Neuromuscular monitoring was carried out using TOF Watch SX® (Organon Ltd., Dublin, Ireland) acceleromyography, with skin electrodes located at the ulnar nerve trace for contractions of adductor pollicis muscle.\nBefore the operations to assess the PONV risks of patients, the simpliﬁed Apfel scoring system was used: (gender: male:0, female:1) + (history of PONV or motion sickness: no:0, yes:1) + (smoking status: no:0, yes:1) + (anticipated use of postoperative opioids: no:0, yes:1).14 Patients with a score of two were given 4 mg iv dexamethasone (Deksamet 8 mg/2 mL, Osel ˙ ¸, Beykoz,\nIlac\n˙Istanbul) before induction, while patients with a score of 3 and above were additionally given 4 mg iv ondansetron (Ondaren 4 mg/2 mL, Vem ˙ ¸, Mecidiyeköy,˙ at the\nIlac Istanbul) end of surgery.15\nGeneral anesthesia was induced by iv 1  g kg−1 fentanyl and 2.5 mg kg−1 propofol. With the loss of consciousness (loss of eyelash reﬂex), iv 0.6 mg kg−1 rocuronium was applied. Orotracheal intubation was performed when no response was yielded with Train of Four (TOF) stimulation of TOF-Guard. After intubation the patient was mechani-cally ventilated in the controlled mode where the end-tidal CO2 pressure was kept between 35 and 40 mmHg. Anes-thesia was maintained with 2% sevoﬂurane in 50% O2/air mixture and 0.2---0.7  g kg−1 min−1 iv remifentanil infu-sion. Additional iv bolus of 0.1---0.2 mg kg−1 rocuronium was administered during surgical procedure provided that TOF ratio to be 10% or lower. No neuromuscular blocker agent was used if the remaining time to the end of surgery was less than 30 minutes. At the end of the surgery, anes-thetic drug administration was ceased and the patient was manually ventilated with 100% oxygen. According to the randomization schedule, antagonization of neuromuscular blockade was provided with intravenous administration of 0.05 mg kg−1 neostigmine and 0.02 mg kg−1 atropine for the patients in Group N and 2 mg kg−1 sugammadex for the patients in Group S when reappearance of the second twitch (T2) on the TOF. The patients were extubated after aspi-ration of oropharyngeal secretions with the 90% recovery of TOF value. Additional iv administration of 0.025 mg kg−1\nneostigmine and 0.01 mg kg−1 atropine in Group N and 2 mg kg−1 sugammadex in Group S was planned in case of need (should the TOF value stay under 90% after 5 minutes).\nIn all patients iv 1 gr paracetamol (Parol 10 mg mL−1, Atabay, Kadıköy, ˙Istanbul) infusion was administered for postoperative analgesia at end of the surgery and every 8 hours in ﬁrst postoperative day. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 1 to 10. Intravenous 50 mg dexketoprofen (Arveles 50 mg/2 mL, Ufsa ˙ ¸, Topkapı,\nIlac\n˙ was given on when VAS score >4. Administration Istanbul)\nof iv 1 mg kg−1 tramadol (Contramal 50 mg mL−1, A˙I, Sarıyer, ˙ for postoperative analgesia were planned as rescue Istanbul)\nagents.\nThe patients were monitored and assessed for 24 hours; hourly for the ﬁrst 6 hours, every 2 hours in the 6---12 hours interval and, subsequently, every 4 hours. They were asked speciﬁcally about pain, nausea, vomiting and other side effect. In all patients, nausea and vomiting were assessed by the same researcher (NT) using a four point verbal descriptive scale as described in previous studies: 0 = not nauseated, 1 = nauseated, not vomiting, 2 = nauseated, one to two episodes of vomiting, 3 = nauseated, more than two episodes of vomiting during the observation period).16\nIn the presence of continuing nausea (>5 min) or active vomiting, iv 4 mg ondansetron was administered, if not given as prophylactic. If ondansetron was previously administered the medication was not given again within 6 hours but meto-clopramide 0.2 mg kg−1 was given instead.\nPatient characteristics, type of surgery, amount of opi-oid consumption and duration of anesthesia were recorded. Complications after the surgery such as headache, cough, respiratory depression, hypertension, bradycardia, sore throat, gastrointestinal system complaints were also noted. HR below 50 pulse min−1 was considered as bradycardia and managed with 0.5 mg iv atropine. MAP above 125 mmHg was considered as hypertension and managed with 0.1 mg iv nitroglycerin.\nPower analysis\nIn a previous study,16 the incidence of PONV was reported as 30% with the same neostigmine dose as our study while it was 11% with placebo. According to an evaluation based on a this study, 44 patients in each group would be required in order to detect 20% change with 80% power and 5% signiﬁ-cance (˛ = 0.05, ˇ = 0.80) in two way signiﬁcant interactions (Minitab 13.1 Inc., State College, PA, USA). We planned to include 100 patients in this study to allow for dropouts.\nStatistical analysis\nData obtained in the study were analyzed with SPSS 16.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were stated as mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables and as number and percentage for nominal variables. Distribution analysis was made with the Kolmogorov---Smirnov test. Age, BMI, remifentanil consump-tion, surgery time were evaluated with student t test. The Chi-square or the Fisher exact test was used for categori-cal data such as gender, ASA physical status, rate of PONV,\n \n150	Ö.

A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically signiﬁcant.\nResults\nThe study included two groups with 50 patients in each group. Two patients in Group N were excluded from the study as their surgeries lasted more than 2 hours. The demographic data in both groups were similar (Table 1). There was no sig-niﬁcant difference between the patients in terms of PONV risk scores, surgical durations and consumed remifentanil amounts (Table 1). In Group N, 24 patients (50%) underwent head and neck surgery, 13 (27%) had urology, 4 (8%) had orthopedic and 7 patients (15%) had general surgery pro-cedures. In Group S, 29 patients (58%) had head and neck surgery, 11 (22%) had urology, 5 (10%) had orthopedic and 5 patients (10%) had general surgery procedures. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the groups in terms of type of surgery undergone (p > 0.05).\nIn the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) during 1 hour post-operative monitoring, 13 patients in Group N (27%) and 4 patients in Group S (8%) had nausea and/or vomiting. The rate was higher by a statistically signiﬁcant degree in Group N (p = 0.016). In the later 24 hour monitoring, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference observed in the inci-dence and severity of PONV between the groups (p > 0.05, Table 2). However the number of patients given ondansetron in Group N was signiﬁcantly high (16 patients in Group N, 6 in Group S, p = 0.011). The postoperative analgesic treatments in both groups were similar (Table 2). There was no signiﬁ-cant difference between the groups in terms of side effects (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nIn our study comparing the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine, used to antagonize the effects of neuromus-cular blocker agents, on incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, less PONV was observed in the ﬁrst hour postoperative with the use of sugammadex compared to\nTable 2 Incidence and severity of PONV and antiemetic\nand analgesic treatment in groups.\nGroup N Group S p\nn = 48 n = 50\nPONV at PACU 0.016\nNo 35 (73%) 46 (92%)\nYes 13 (27%) 4 (8%)\nPONV at PACU NS\n0 35 (73%) 46 (92%)\n1 9 (19%) 3 (6%)\n2 3 (6%) 1 (2%)\n3 1 (2%) 0\n1 --- 6 hours NS\n0 43 (90%) 48 (96%)\n1 4 (8%) 2 (4%)\n2 1 (2%) 0\n6---12 hours NS\n0 45 (94%) 50 (100%)\n1 3 (6%) 0\n2 0 0\nAntiemetic 16 (33%) 6 (12%) 0.011\ntreatment (n)\n(Ondansetron)\nAnalgesic 14 (30%) 17 (34%) NS\ntreatment (n)\n(Dexketoprofen)\nAnalgesic 3 (6%) 4 (8%) NS\ntreatment (n)\n(Tramadol)\nData are presented as frequencies.

Our cases administered sugammadex had a sig-niﬁcant reduction in the amount of anti-emetics used in the ﬁrst 24 hours postoperative compared with cases adminis-tered neostigmine.\nMany studies have reported the emetic effect of the use of high-dose neostigmine for neuromuscular blockage antag-onism. King et al.17 in a study researching the effects of neostigmine on PONV, administered one group neostigmine-atropine for neuromuscular blockage antagonism and used no medication for the other group. In conclusion they iden-tiﬁed a signiﬁcant difference with higher nausea by 68% to\n \nSugammadex and neostigmine on postoperative nausea and vomiting	151\n \n\n \n32% and vomiting by 47% to 11% in the neostigmine-atropine group. Ding et al.18 studied laparoscopic tubal ligation and found signiﬁcantly more PONV in the PACU when neostigmine was compared with placebo after mivacurium, 65% versus 25% respectively. Meta-analyses demonstrate that high-dose neostigmine (>2.5 mg) is associated with increased PONV and that reducing the dose can decrease PONV risk.7,19\nHowever, the clinical importance of neostigmine’s effects on PONV has been questioned. The results of a meta-analysis study including 15 studies, found the evidence that neostig-mine increased the risk of PONV to be insufﬁcient.20 A study researching the effects of neostigmine on PONV after abdominal hysterectomy operations left one group to spon-taneously recover from neuromuscular blockage induced by mivacurium while the other group was antagonized with 2 mg neostigmine. They did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference between the groups in terms of both nausea and vomiting. In conclusion they stated that the use of neostigmine for neu-romuscular block antagonism did not increase the incidence or severity of PONV.21 It has been reported that neuromuscu-lar block antagonism with 2 mg neostigmine in laparoscopic gynecological operations did not cause an increase in the incidence of PONV.22 The noticeable point in these two studies is the amount of neostigmine used. It has been determined that use of neostigmine in doses above 2.5 mg increases the risk of PONV.7,15-17\nA study by Lovstad et al.16 compared the effect of 50  g kg−1 dose of neostigmine with a placebo group on PONV in women after laparoscopic gynecology operations. At the end of surgery all patients were given iv 0.05 mg kg−1 ondansetron. In the ﬁrst 6 hours they found the nau-sea rate in the neostigmine group was 30%, while in the placebo group this rate was 11%. The necessity for rescue anti-emetic medication (metoclopramide 0.2 mg kg−1 and droperidol 0.025 mg kg−1) was 28% in the neostigmine group and 7% in the placebo group. They reported that both these differences were statistically signiﬁcant. The researchers did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference in vomiting rates in the ﬁrst 6 hours. Monitoring from 6 to 24 hours, the so-called late period, observed no signiﬁcant difference in either nausea or vomiting. In conclusion this study reported that high dose neostigmine for neuromuscular blockage antagonism caused an increase in the risk of nausea in the ﬁrst 6 hours after surgery for women undergoing laparoscopic surgery, even with ondansetron prophylaxis. The dose of neostigmine used in this study, when the weight of the patients in the study is taken into account, is above the 2.5 mg dose stated to cause an increased risk of PONV.\nThe studies assessing the effect on postoperative nausea and vomiting when sugammadex and neostigmine are used to reverse the effect of neuromuscular blocker agents are very limited. According to the results of a study assessing postoperative results of neuromuscular blockage antago-nism and including 1440 patients (772 sugammadex, 212 neostigmine, 510 no reversal), the incidence of PONV in the PACU was found to be signiﬁcantly high in the neostigmine group compared to the sugammadex group (21.5% vs. 13.6%, p < 0.05). The researchers did not determine any signiﬁ-cant difference between the sugammadex and no-reversal groups. In a study which reported the use of intraoperative anti-emetics was more frequent in the neostigmine group, they emphasized that the cause of increased risk of PONV\nin the sugammadex group was urgent surgery and abdomi-nal surgical procedures. When the researchers assessed the results of the study they stated that the cost increase caused by use of sugammadex was off-set by the reduction in inci-dence of PONV.23\nA study by Koyuncu et al.13 compared the effects of 70  g kg−1 neostigmine and 2 mg kg−1 sugammadex on PONV when used for neuromuscular blockage antagonism in 100 patients undergoing extremity surgery. In the study with induction of anesthesia using propofol, fentanyl and rocuro-nium while maintenance used desﬂurane and nitrous oxide with oxygen, 0.5 mg kg−1 iv meperidine was administered at the end of surgery for postoperative analgesia. They did not administer intraoperative anti-emetic medication. PONV was treated with 4 mg ondansetron iv and if it continued 10 mg metoclopramide iv. When the ﬁndings of the study are evaluated, though there was no difference in anesthesia durations and Apfel scores of patients, they stated that the nausea and vomiting scores in the PACU were statistically sig-niﬁcantly lower in the sugammadex group. However during 24 hours postoperative nausea and vomiting was observed in 60% of the sugammadex group and 58% of the neostigmine group and they reported there was no signiﬁcant difference. In conclusion comparing sugammadex with neostigmine they determined that there was a slight and temporary reduc-tion in the incidence of PONV. They did not ﬁnd a positive effect of the return of gastrointestinal functions and ambu-lation. The researchers linked their high rates of PONV, when compared to the literature, to the use of nitrous oxide for anesthesia maintenance and the use of opioids for postop-erative analgesia.13\nThe results of our study are similar to the study by Koyuncu et al.13 in identifying a lower PONV incidence in the 1st hour of monitoring in PACU with sugammadex. How-ever in the 24 hour monitoring period, the study by Koyuncu et al. had different and higher results than in the litera-ture and our study. In our study during the postoperative 1 --- 6 hours the nausea and vomiting incidence was 10% in Group N and 4% in Group S, while between 6 and 24 hours it was found to be 6% in Group N and 0% in Group S. We believe the basic reason for the differences from the results of Koyuncu et al. is that in situations with Apfel score of 2 and above we administered antiemetic medication. Another important reason may be the amount of neostigmine used. Koyuncu et al. used 70  g kg−1 in their study. In our study the dose of neostigmine was 50  g kg−1, which is similar to many studies in the literature.7,16,20 When the mean weights are considered, the mean amount of neostigmine used per patient in our study was 3.65 mg, while this was 5.25 mg in the study by Koyuncu et al. Other possible reasons may be listed as differences in anesthetic method (we did not use N2O for maintenance or meperidine for postoperative anal-gesia) and our shorter duration of surgery (about 30 minutes shorter). It has been determined that the increase in surgical duration may increase the incidence of PONV (each 30 min increase in duration increases PONV risk by 60%, so that a baseline risk of 10% is increased by 16% after 30 min).10\nIn our study in the postoperative 24 hour monitoring period, the number of patients given anti-emetic treatment with ondansetron was signiﬁcantly lower in the sugam-madex group (12% compared to 33%). Ledowski et al.23 in a retrospective scan reported similar results, with lower\n \n152	Ö. Ya˘ et al.\n	gan\n \n\n \nanti-emetic medication administration in the PACU for the sugammadex group.\nThe most important limitation of our study is that though we did not include surgeries known to be risk factors for PONV, it was not completed with a single type of surgery.\nIn conclusion, this study shows that neostigmine reversal in increased PONV at PACU and use of antiemetic rescue medication during the postoperative 24 hours. In terms of PONV, the use of sugammadex for neuromuscular blockage antagonism may be a better choice for patients with high risk or where this situation is undesirable.\nClinical trial registration\nNCT02286752.\nEthics committee approval\nEthics committee approval was received for this study from Ethics Committee of Ondokuz Mayıs University (2014/779).

Some laparoscopic procedures   \nare performed with administration of a single bolus of a Dan Med J \n2017;64(5):A5364 muscle relaxant, which is followed by spontaneous neu­\nromuscular recovery [7­9]. These procedures are chosen \nto minimize the risk of prolonged emergence from an­\naesthesia, awareness and post­operative residual mus­\ncle paralysis, which may cause respiratory complications \n[10, 11].\nRecent studies indicate benefits of deep NMB on \nsurgical conditions [6­8, 12].

In short, anaesthesia was induced and \nmaintained with propofol and remifentanil, adjusted  \nunder guidance of middle arterial blood pressure and a \ndepth of anaesthesia monitor aiming at an entropy level \nof 30­50. Ventilation was performed with volume con­\ntrol mode with a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg, a frequency of \n10­12/min and a positive end­expiratory pressure of 5 \ncm H O aiming at normocapnia (end­tidal CO 4.5­5.5 \n2 2\nkPa). Neuromuscular monitoring followed good clinical \nresearch practice guidelines and depth of NMB was \nmonitored using train­of­four (TOF) and post­tetanic­ count (PTC) ulnar nerve stimulation [14]. Tracheal intub­\nation was performed 2 min after administration of the muscle relaxant 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium. In patients allo­\ncated to deep NMB, a bolus of 0.7 mg/kg rocuronium was administered immediately after intubation, and in­\nfusion of rocuronium (0.3­0.4 mg/kg/h) was started when PTC > 0 and titrated toward PTC 0­1. In patients  allocated to standard NMB, a similar volume of saline 0.9% was given and infusion of saline 0.9% (2­3 ml/kg/h) was started after 20­30 min. In the standard NMB group, no supplemental rocuronium was administered, unless requested by the gynaecologist.\nThe investigator managed the insufflation of the ab­ domen to either 8 or 12 mmHg pneumoperitoneum. The insufflator alarm was activated if the pressure exceeded 5 mmHg of the pre­set pressure. Patients were placed in the lithotomy position in a 30­degree head­down body position. The same two gynaecologists working together performed all operations and were instructed in regis­\ntering any sudden patient movement, any alarms from the insufflator indicating increased intra­abdominal pressure and any incidences in which the abdominal wall felt tight. In cases in which the surgical overview was considered unacceptable, the protocol allowed the pneumoperitoneum to be increased to 12 mmHg in combination with a bolus of saline in patients allocated to the deep NMB group.

If none of these interventions improved the surgical overview, the gynaecologists could decide on an inter­ vention according to their usual clinical practice. Imme­ diately after closure of the abdominal wall fascia, the  gynaecologists evaluated the surgical conditions on a four­point rating scale (1: excellent, 2: good, 3: accept­ able, 4: poor) [8].\nAfter insertion of the last suture, NMB was antag­ onized with sugammadex, if needed. Blinding of the gy­ naecologists regarding level of NMB and the level of pneumoperitoneum was ensured by turning the insuffla­ tor and covering the display. Also, the hand with the neuromuscular device was covered. The attending anaesthetist, the investigator and the operating nurses were not blinded.\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of sudden abdominal contractions. Other outcomes were inciden­ ces of insufflator alarms due to increased intra­abdom­ inal pressure, incidences of increasing abdominal wall tension and surgical conditions during abdominal fascia closure using a four­point rating scale.\nThe patients’ case files were reviewed on the 21th post­operative day to identify any adverse events or re­ actions. Adverse events or reactions were considered serious if fatal and life­threatening if they had caused permanent disability or required prolonged hospitaliza­ tion. \nThe study was conducted according to the Inter­\nnational Conference on Harmonization/Good Clinical Research Practice guidelines [15]. \nstatistical analysis \nNormally distributed data were described with mean and standard deviation. Non­normally distributed data were described with median and range. Fisher’s exact test was used for comparing groups with respect to the primary outcome. The association between the rating of surgical conditions and allocation to level of NMB was tested with the Mann­Whitney U test. p < 0.05 was con­ sidered statistically significant.\nThe gynaecologists estimated that they experienced abdominal contractions in every second patient in the standard NMB group during laparoscopic hysterectomy. It was estimated that the incidence of sudden abdom­ inal contractions could be reduced from 50% to 10% with a deep NMB and 8 mmHg compared with a stand­ ard NMB and 12 mmHg.

When events occurred, 11 of 19 patients had \nentropy values between 30­50 as set by our protocol.  \nNo patients had intraoperative awareness.\nIn the standard NMB group, 46 (84%) patients had \nrecovery of NMB [14] upon application of pneumoperi­\ntoneum (insertion of Veress needle). Five (9%) patients \nhad a moderate NMB (TOF count 1­3 [14]). In four (7%) \npatients, NMB never reached a moderate level after ad­\nministration of 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium. The average op­\nerating time (from insertion of Veress needle to last su­\nture) in the standard NMB group was 70 (range: 42­148) \nmin. On average, 87% (range: 59­100%) of the operating \ntime was performed without NMB (TOF ratio > 0.9) in \nthe standard NMB group. A total of 41 of 55 patients \n(75%) in the standard NMB group had at least 80% of \nsurgery performed with no NMB.\nIn 83 patients, the abdominal fascia was sutured \nand surgical conditions were evaluated. Deep NMB sig­\nnificantly improved surgical conditions estimated on a \nfour­point rating scale while suturing the abdominal fas­\ncia (p < 0.001) (table 3). There was no difference in the \nduration of surgery (65 min in the deep NMB group ver­\nsus 70 min in the standard NMB group (p = 0.624), re­\nspectively [13]. All operations were completed according \nto allocation, i.e. there was no need to either increase \nintraabdominal pressure or administer a bolus of muscle \nrelaxant.\nWe registered adverse events requiring hospitaliza­\ntion in seven patients: Three with infection (two in the \ndeep NMB group), one with lesion of the bladder (deep \nNMB group), which was sutured and repaired during \nsurgery, one with a vesico­vaginal fistula (standard NMB \ngroup) which developed three weeks after the primary \nsurgery and one with post­operative bleeding (standard \nNMB group) requiring repeated surgery. One patient \n(deep NMB group) with two previous Caesarean sections \nand heavy adhesions had both a haematoma and infec­\ndiscUssiOn\nWe found that deep NMB and pneumoperitoneum 8 mmHg compared with standard NMB and pneumoperi­\ntoneum 12 mmHg prevented sudden abdominal con­\ntractions during laparoscopic hysterectomy. Moreover, deep NMB and pneumoperitoneum 8 mmHg improved surgical conditions during suturing of the abdominal fas­ cia compared with standard NMB and pneumoperiton­ eum 12 mmHg. \nOur findings are important, especially for laparos­ copic hysterectomy since the establishment of a steady operating field is crucial, e.g. during morcellation where a rotating knife is used inside the abdomen. However, establishment of deep NMB throughout the procedure was unable to prevent adverse events such as bladder lesion, development of haematoma and vesico­vaginal fistula. In addition, these cases were regarded as ex­\ntremely complicated due to previous Caesarean sections with heavy adhesions as well as deeply located retro­\nperitoneal fibroids. According to the surgeons, these cases developed independently of the level of NMB.\nA systematic review found that deeper levels of NMB compared with more moderate levels of NMB im­\nprove subjective ratings of surgical conditions during certain laparoscopic procedures [16]. Our results are in accordance with these findings, though the majority of patients in the standard NMB group received only a shallow level of block and most of them were unpara­ lysed during major parts of the surgery since the sur­ geons did not request additional boluses of muscle re­\nlaxant.\nOne of the strengths of this study was the blinding of the gynaecologists who registered the incidences of sudden abdominal contractions and assessed the sur­ gical conditions. However, the lack of incidences in the patients receiving continuous deep NMB may also have introduced bias in the subjective ratings after suturing of the fascia.

However, donor hepatectomy is frequently\nassociated with postoperative coagulation abnormality as they undergo major hepatectomy in which more than half of the liver volume is usually resected.[2–4] Although the clinical signiﬁcance of posthepatectomy coagulation abnormality is still less clear, there are concerns that it may lead to complications such as\n[2]\npostoperative intra-abdominal bleeding or relaparotomy.\nSugammadex (Bridion; MSD, Oss, The Netherlands) is a selective relaxant-binding agent which may replace the conven-tional reversal agents of neuromuscular blockade (NMB). During\nlastdecade,theuseofsugammadexhasbeenrapidlyincreased,asit has been shown to improve surgical conditions[5,6]\nand postoper-ative outcomes[7,8] with its ability to reverse even profound NMB fast and reliably. However, concerns have been raised about the\nhypotheticalriskofpostoperativebleedingregardingsugammadex\nadministration, because preclinical in vitro studies demonstrated\nupto20%increaseinprothrombintime(PT)andactivatedpartial\n[9]\nthromboplastin time (aPTT) after sugammadex use. Further-more, several reports advocated that sugammadex may be\nassociated with longer clotting time and higher amount of\npostoperative bleeding.[10–12] Nonetheless, no safety or clinical effect data have been published thus far on sugammadex in living liver donors, although these coagulation abnormalities have the potential to increase the risk of postoperative bleeding. In this\n \n1\n \nMoon et al. Medicine (2018) 97:11	Medicine\n \n\n \nstudy, we compared the postoperative coagulation proﬁles and outcomes of sugammadex versus pyridostigmine in donors receiving living donor hepatectomy.\n2. Methods\nOur institutional review board approved this retrospective observational study (No. 2015-1171). We reviewed clinical data of the 992 consecutive donors who underwent donor hepatectomy forlivingdonorliver transplantation between September2013 and August 2016. We collected patient’s baseline characteristics, intraoperative variables, and postoperative variables using our institutions record system (Asan Medical Center Information System Electronic Medical Records). Baseline characteristics included age, sex, and body mass index. Both preoperative and immediatepostoperativelaboratoryvariableswerecollected,which included hemoglobin, platelet, PT, aPTT, total bilirubin, albumin, and creatinine. Intraoperative variables were graft volume, volume of infused ﬂuids, urine output, and operation time. Amount of bleeding in the surgical drains during 24h after surgery was collected. Postoperative hospital day, admission to the intensive careunit,andneedofrelaparotomyforbleedingcontrolwerenoted.\nInduction of anesthesia was performed using 4 to 5mg/kg thiopental sodium, 1 to 2mg/kg fentanyl, and 0.6mg/kg rocuronium. Intraoperative anesthetic management was fol-lowed our institutional protocol for donor hepatectomy, which has beenpreviouslydescribedin detail.[13,14] Beforegraft harvest, 5000 IU of intravenous heparin was administered and reversed with 50mg of protamine immediately after graft harvest. At the end of the surgery, either one of the reversal agents (sugammadex or pyridostigmine) was administered after conﬁrmation of over 2 twitch responses on the train-of-4 stimulation. Sugammadex was given in dose of 4mg/kg, and pyridostigmine was given in dose of 0.25mg/kg with glycopyrrolate 0.01mg/kg. In cases when adequate reversal (train-of-4 ratio>0.9) was not achieved with pyridostigmine within 10 min, additional dose of sugammadex 4 mg/kg was administered. All patients were extubated after reaching train-of-4 ratio 0.9.\nSurgical management also followed our institution’s standard-ized protocol.[1] Brieﬂy, through J-shaped incision, cholecystec-tomy was performed. After identiﬁcation of bile duct anatomy, hepatic parenchymal dissection was performed using cavitron ultrasonic suction aspirator (CUSA Excel,Valleylab Inc, Boulder, CO). Various types of grafts were harvested including (extended) right, right posterior, left, left plus caudate, and (extended) left lateral lobes. Argon beam coagulator and ﬁbrin sealants were used for hemostasis.\nThe primary outcome was changes of immediate postoperative PT and other laboratory variables compared with preoperative value. Secondary outcomes included amount of drain during ﬁrst 24h after surgery, need of relaparotomy for postoperative bleeding, admission to intensive care unit, and length of hospital stay. Variables are expressed as numbers and percentages, means ±standard deviation, or median with the interquartile range as appropriate. Between group comparison were performed using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables, and the Student t test or Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables as appropriate.\nTable 1\nPatient characteristics and preoperative laboratory data.\nPyridostigmine Sugammadex\n(n=609) (n=383) P Age, y 29.3±9.3 30.2±9.6 .150 Sex (female) 199 (32.7%) 190 (49.6%) <.001 Height, cm 169.6±8.3 169.1±9.1 .420 Weight, kg 66.2±11.5 67.6±13.1 .091 Donor liver lobe type, right/left 505/101 323/60 .560 Hemoglobin, mg/dL 14.6±1.4 14.5±1.5 .201\n3/\nPlatelet,  10 mL 249±50 253±55 .189 PT, INR 0.99±0.05 1.01±0.05 <.001 aPTT, s 28.1±2.2 28.2±2.3 .394 Total bilirubin, mg/dL 0.7±0.3 0.7±0.3 .867 Albumin, g/dL 4.3±0.3 4.3±0.3 .145 Creatinine, mg/dL 0.82±0.16 0.80±0.16 .146 Values are expressed as mean±standard deviation, median (interquartile range), or number (%). aPTT=activated partial thromboplastin time, INR=international normalization ratio, PT= prothrombin time.\ndonors with pyridostigmine, 51 (7.7%) failed to extubate at ﬁrst attempt because of residual NMB, thus sugammadex was subsequently administered.

The causes for admission to intensive care unit were not related to residual NMB or respiratory complication in any patients. 4. Discussion\nCompared with pyridostigmine, use of 4mg/kg of sugammadex in living liver donor did not affect PT prolongation, amount of blood drain volume, and incidence relaparotomy for bleeding control within 24 h after donor hepatectomy. Anesthesia time and postoperative hospital stay were signiﬁcantly short in sugammadex group than those in pyridostigmine care group. These results suggest sugammadex can be safely used in donor hepatectomy despite transient coagulation abnormalities are frequently seen in living liver donors.\nWhen sugammadex was ﬁrst introduced, supplemented informationstatedthatsugammadexcouldresultinprolongation of PT andaPTT by 10%to 20% in preclinical in vivo and in vitro studies.[9] In fact, presumed anticoagulant effect of sugammadex, at least in part, was the reason for the US Food and Drug Administration not to approve sugammadex in 2008.[15] Clinical\ntrials in healthy subjects showed transient aPTT and PTT prolongations after 4 and 16mg/kg of sugammadex.[12,16] Following clinical studies in surgical patients also reported the similar coagulation abnormalities.[10,11] Thus, according to the current drug supplementation, additional caution should be exercised when used in high-dose or in patients with high risk of bleeding.[17] Not only sugammadex may cause coagulation abnormality, but liver resection also causes PT prolongation because of consumptive or dilutional coagulopathy after hepatic resection.WehypothesizedthatevenminorPTprolongationmay be harmful to donors because the concurrence of 2 situations can aggravate coagulation abnormality in donors at a high risk of postoperative bleeding. As the donor safety should be of utmost priority, even a theoretical bleeding risk needs to be clariﬁed. Our results demonstrate that treatment with 4mg/kg of sugammadex was not associated with an increased bleeding risk in living liver donor as compared with pyridostigmine. This ﬁnding was robust insofar as it was observed across laboratory ﬁndings and various clinical endpoints of postoperative bleeding and blood loss. The average prolongation of PT (INR) was 0.21 for sugammadex versus 0.20 for the pyridostigmine group,showing that treatment with sugammadex did not result in a larger increase in PT compared with pyridostigmine.\nMost of data on the effect of sugammadex on coagulation are limited to few plasmatic coagulation assay and platelet function testing, limiting the understanding this drug.[10,12,16,18] These studiessuggestedthateffectofsugammadexonPTandaPTTwas not related to platelet function or factor Xa activity.[16,18] According to a recent study by Dirkmann et al, its anticoagulant effect is rather seems to be an in vitro artifact caused by phospholipid-binding effect.[15] However, there are still\n \n3\n \nMoon et al. Medicine (2018) 97:11	Medicine\n \n\n \ncontroversy about the relation between sugammadex and postoperative bleeding especially in high-risk patients. Regarding its clinical implication, no study has demonstrated evidence of increased bleeding risk after sugammadex use except 1 study.[11] Even the author of this study commented that increased bleeding that they found may associate with other uncontrolled factors rather than sugammadex. In line with previous studies, our study demonstrated that the amount of drain volume was similar in both sugammadex and pyridostigmine groups. The incidence of relaparotomy for postoperative bleeding was not different between the 2 groups. Actually, there was no case of relaparotomy in sugammadex group.\nThe key secondary objectives of current study were to compare short-term outcome between 2 groups. Many previous studies demonstrated that sugammadex reverses NMB 3 to 8 times faster than conventional reversal agent does.[19,20] In addition, sugammadex could reduce the incidence of residual NMB,[21] thus may result in reduced early postoperative pulmonary complications.[7,22] Postoperative residual muscle relaxation is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.[23] Furthermore, the subjectively felt degree of paralysis constitutes a substantial contributor to postoperative emotional stress, especially those with enormous psychological strain, who are frequently encountered among living liver donors.[24] These psychological burden may have a negative inﬂuence on outcome.[25] Our data implicated that sugammadex obviously has clinical beneﬁts in living liver donors. In our study, sugammadex use was associated with shorter duration of surgery and hospital stay, despite that ICU administration was similar in both groups. In addition, 7.7% of donors who treated with pyridostigmine failed to extubate at ﬁrst attempt because of residual NMB, thus sugammadex was subsequently adminis-tered. We speculate that such ability of sugammadex may help to enhance patient’s safety after donor hepatectomy.\nWe speculate that the shorter duration of anesthesia could be explained as one of the advantages of sugammadex. In a study regarding fast track bariatric surgery, anesthesia time of patients using neostigmine and sugammadex were 95±21 and 47.9±6.4 min, respectively (P<.001).[26] In another study, sugammadex group showed shorter duration of anesthetic recovery time when compared to the conventional reversal agent (24.1 [21.9–26.5] min vs. 19.9 [18.1–21.8] min, P=.020). Our result was in accordance with those previous studies. In our study, the time fromtheendoftheproceduretodischargeofoperationroomwas shorter in sugammadex group, although it was not statistically signiﬁcant (12 [8–16] min vs. 11 [8–15] min for pyridostigmine group and sugammadex group, P=.050). When excluding patients who received both pyridostigmine and sugammadex due to residual NMB, the time for sugammadex group was 10.5 (7–15) min (n=281, P=.008 for vs. pyridostigmine group). We speculate that it partly explains the shorter duration of anesthesia in sugammadex group. Another reason might be that sugamma-dex may allow the practitioners to maintain deeper NMB till the end of the surgery, thus it might improve surgical condition especially during the time of wound closure. Previous studies demonstrated that profound NMB may facilitate the surgical procedure and could shorten the duration of the surgery.[5,6,26] As sugammadex enables rapid and reliable reversal of NMB, a better surgical condition could be provided until the very end of the surgery. Regarding the hospital stay, the difference between the 2 groups was small (11.7±4.0 vs. 11.0±1.9 for pyridos-tigmine and sugammadex groups, P=.002), thus it might not have clinical signiﬁcance. Moreover, considering that length of\nhospital stay can be inﬂuenced by various factors, it is hard to deﬁne 1 speciﬁc reason for it.\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, retrospective design of study is clearly inferior to a prospective randomized trial. Consequently, although the large number of donors analyzed provides strong statistical power, our results should beviewedinthecontextoftheretrospectivestudydesign.Second, patient selection was solely dependent on attending anesthesi-ologist’s decision, thus it might be relatively biased. Actually, sex in both groups was signiﬁcantly different, although this may not affecttheresultofstudy.Lastly,inourresult,sugammadexgroup showed similar prolongation in PT compared with pyridostig-minegroup,and anticoagulanteffect onPT wasrelatively smaller compared with previous reports.[10–12] It is probably because of the time gap between sugammadex use and blood sampling. While the effect of sugammadex on coagulation is known to be limitedandtransient(<1h),[10] ittookrelativelylongertimefrom sugammadex administration to blood sampling in our study (median 149min).\nIn conclusion, sugammadex was not associated with increased bleeding tendency in donors at a high risk of postoperative coagulopathy. Meanwhile, donors in sugammadex group were associated with reduced anesthesia time and hospital stay. Therefore, we believe that sugammadex can be safely used and will decrease morbidity in donor undergoing living-donor hepatectomy.\nReferences\n[1] Hwang S, Lee SG, Lee YJ, et al.

(Anesth Analg 2018;126:1505–8)\n \nAnaphylaxis is defned as a life-threatening hyper-\nsensitivity reaction with systemic allergic symp-\ntoms; it occurs rarely during surgery and anesthesia. \nNeuromuscular blocking agents and antibiotics are consid-\nered common causes of anaphylaxis.1 When symptoms asso-\nciated with histamine reaction, such as skin rash, hypotension, \ntachycardia, and wheezing, appear suddenly after injection of \nthese agents, anaphylaxis is suspected, and treatment should \nbe initiated immediately. As far as is possible, it is essential to \nknow the risk of anaphylaxis for these types of agents.\nSugammadex, a reversal agent for rocuronium and \nvecuronium, is available for clinical use in many countries. \nWhereas it has advantages over anticholinesterases, such \nas faster recovery from neuromuscular blockade and lesser \nincidence of residual paralysis,2,3 there are concerns regard-\ning allergy and anticoagulation.4,5 A number of cases of \nhypersensitivity reaction in response to sugammadex have \nbeen reported,6 but the incidence of anaphylaxis has not been \nsuffciently elucidated.

The primary outcome was the incidence of sugammadex-associated ana-phylaxis, essential information for patient safety.\nMETHODS\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of Jikei University School of Medicine (Tokyo, Japan) in November 2015. A retrospective investigation was performed using the databases documenting anesthetic management and peri-operative events at the Department of Anesthesiology, Jikei University School of Medicine.\nAll surgical cases attended by anesthesiologists from September 2012 to August 2015 were evaluated. In each case, an attending anesthesiologist qualifed by the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists completed and submitted an assessment form of perioperative events, including hypersen-sitivity reactions and other adverse events related to circula-tion, respiration, the central or peripheral nervous system, airway, catheter insertion, depth of anesthesia, etc. All assess-ment forms of perioperative events during the study period were reviewed, and cases of intraoperative hypersensitivity reactions were identifed in light of the anesthetic records and the free-text comments on the form. Applicable clinical signs of intraoperative hypersensitivity reactions include erythema, urticaria, hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, bronchospasm, etc, which were described in the clinical severity scale of immediate hypersensitivity reactions adapted from Ring and Messmer.7,8 These were assessed to determine whether they corresponded to the defnition of anaphylaxis according to the World Allergy Organization guidelines (Table 1).9 Cases of potential sugammadex-associated anaphylaxis were exam-ined further in terms of patient background (ie, allergy his-tory, comorbidity of asthma, surgical history, and previous exposure to sugammadex), sugammadex dose, onset of reac-tion, clinical symptoms, treatments, time to achieve hemody-namic stability, diagnostic tests, and course.\nThe total number of patients who received sugam-madex during the study period was determined, along \n \nMay 2018 • Volume 126 • Number 5 www.anesthesia-analgesia.org 1505\nCopyright © 2017 International Anesthesia Research Society.

After achiev-\ning hemodynamic stability with treatment for anaphylaxis, \n1 patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for over-\nnight observation and was administered a single dose of \nhydrocortisone (200 mg). The 5 others were moved to the \ngeneral ward after observation in the postanesthesia care \nunit, and received no additional medication. All patients \nwho experienced anaphylaxis potentially caused by sugam-\nmadex recovered with no major problems, including no \nbiphasic reaction.\nDISCUSSION\nThis retrospective, single-center study was undertaken \nto elucidate the incidence of anaphylaxis associated with \nsugammadex. The total number of patients who received \nsugammadex during the study period was 15,479, and the \nincidence of anaphylaxis potentially caused by sugam-\nmadex was 0.039% (6/15,479; 95% CI, 0.014%–0.084%). \nAlthough the cause of anaphylaxis was not specifcally identifed in this study, the clinical observations were that symptoms corresponding to anaphylaxis developed soon after injection of sugammadex.\nNeuromuscular blocking agents are considered a com-mon cause of anaphylaxis. A recent study reported that the incidence of anaphylaxis caused by succinylcholine, rocuronium, and atracurium is 0.048% (95% CI, 0.025%– 0.084%), 0.04% (95% CI, 0.015%–0.087%), and 0.0045% (95% CI, 0.00092%–0.013%), respectively.10 Differences in study design should be considered, but the results of the present study imply that the incidence of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis might be as high as that of succinylcholine- or rocuronium-induced anaphylaxis.\nAccording to a report published by the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists in 2013, which was based on investi-gation by the manufacturer, the incidence of sugammadex-associated anaphylaxis was 0.0029%;4 our present result of 0.039% is approximately 13 times this value. We used the same defnition of anaphylaxis as the manufacturer, which does not specify tests, such as skin test, to identify the cause. Whereas the reason for the apparent difference is likely mul-tifactorial, a possible reason for the discrepancy may be the \n \n\n \nTable 2.

In the present study, \nthe perioperative hypersensitivity reactions were reported \nin all cases with a specifc assessment form of perioperative \nevents. In contrast, the data from the manufacturer were \nbased on voluntary reporting. It is very likely that voluntary \nreporting recognized only a subset of cases of sugammadex-\nassociated anaphylaxis. In addition, population parameters \nwere different. Whereas the parameter in the present study \nwas an actual number based on the total number of patients \nwho received sugammadex, the parameter reported by \nthe manufacturer was estimated cases based on the num-\nber of shipments to be distributed. Thus, an amount of \nunused sugammadex might be included in the population \nparameter.\nDiagnostic tests to indicate that anaphylaxis occurred in \nresponse to sugammadex were performed for only 1 case in \nthe present study. The patient showed a positive response \nwith respect to serum tryptase and a negative response to a \ndrug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, an in vitro test \nto identify the causative agent of hypersensitivity reactions. \nNonetheless, the result cannot rule out sugammadex as the \ncause of anaphylaxis because the sensitivity of the drug-\ninduced lymphocyte stimulation test is low.11 Although the \ndefnitive diagnosis could not be made without objective \nevidence from diagnostic tests, the 6 cases are suggestive \nof anaphylaxis caused by sugammadex because the clinical \nsymptoms corresponding to anaphylaxis occurred within \n1–4 minutes after injection of sugammadex at the emer-\ngence from anesthesia.\nA prospective study, including testing for identifcation of \ncause of anaphylaxis, will be necessary to confrm the exact \nincidence of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis. However, we \nconclude that the incidence (0.039%; 95% CI, 0.014%–0.084%) \nmay be similar to that for succinylcholine or rocuronium, and \nit is important to be alert to this possibility.
